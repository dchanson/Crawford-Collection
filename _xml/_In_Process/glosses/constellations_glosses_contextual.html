In his <span class="titlem">“Calendarium Stellaris”</span> for January (mid‐month, 9:30 P.M.), <span class="persName">Aspin</span> highlights <span class="name">Orion</span> as “nearly on the meridian; and below him . . . <span class="name">Lepus (the Hare)</span> and <span class="name">Columba Noachi (Noahʼs Dove)</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 106, 146, 161). Included among the forty‐eight constellations listed by <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span> in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Almagest</span></span>.</p> 
               <p>According to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs geography text, “<span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Orion</span></span>, containing his Sword and luminous Belt”, is considered one of the “most remarkable”
                  constellations “to the naked eye or telescope”, along with “<span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Taurus</span></span>, containing the <span class="name">Pleiades</span>; and <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Ursa Major</span></span>, containing the <span style="font-style:italic">Pointers</span> to the <span class="name">North Star</span>: all visible in our winter evenings” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GOLDSMITHGEOGRAPHY"><span class="persName">Goldsmith</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Grammar of General Geography</span></span></a>, 8). Situated south of <span class="name">Taurus (the Bull)</span> and <span class="name">Gemini (the Twins, <span class="persName">Castor</span> and <span class="persName">Pollux</span>)</span>, which are constellations in the <span class="name">zodiac</span>, <span class="name">Orion</span> is viewed along the celestial equator, below the ecliptic. In the northern hemisphere,
                  it rises low on the eastern horizon during winter evenings and transits westward.</p> 
               <p>Among the most anciently named constellations, <span class="name">Orion</span> is mentioned, for example, in <span class="persName">Homer</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Odyssey</span></span> as one of the constellations that guide <span class="persName">Odysseus</span> (bk. 5), and he also appears to <span class="persName">Odysseus</span> among the dead in the underworld (bk. 11). In mythology, <span class="persName">Orion</span> is a great hunter. He “is represented on the globe by the figure of a man with a
                  sword in his belt, a club in his right hand, and the skin of a lion in his left; he
                  is said by some authors to be the son of <span class="persName">Neptune</span> and <span class="persName">Euryale</span>, a famous huntress; he possessed the disposition of his mother, became the greatest
                  hunter in the world, and boasted that there was not any animal on the <span class="name">earth</span> which he could not conquer”. However, “as a punishment for his temerity”, “in the
                  island of <span class="placeName">Crete</span>, accompanied by <span class="persName">Diana</span> and <span class="persName">Latona</span> in the chase, . . . he perished by the bite of a scorpion” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 53). Accordingly, “he was placed among the stars, in a position directly opposite
                  to that of the <span class="name">Scorpion</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 69; see <a class="link_ref" href="#SCORPIOGLOSS" title="High up there is scorpio (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Scorpio (Scorpion) constellation of the southern Zodiac the second southern and s...">Scorpio</a>; and for other tales about the death of <span class="name">Orion</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 135).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Aspin</span> adds a biblical type, <span class="name">Orion</span> as the “representative of <span class="persName">Nimrod</span>, that ‘mighty hunter’, who is supposed to have been the author of the postdiluvian
                  heresy” (<span class="titlem">Gen. 10:8–9</span>; for <span class="persName">Nimrod</span> as a warrior king who cast off fear of <span class="persName">God</span> by shedding human blood and by organizing a great metropolis crowned by the <span class="placeName">Tower of Babel</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="titlem">Holy Bible</span>, ed. <span class="persName">Scott</span></a>, 1:62, 64; see also <a class="link_ref" href="#PEGASUSGLOSS" title="pegasus (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Pegasus (the Flying Horse) northern constellation bounded (as reckoned in the 1820s prior to obsol..."><span class="name">Pegasus</span></a>). <span class="persName">Aspin</span> also mocks an unsuccessful attempt by “French astronomers” to “change the name of

The iconography of seating the Olympian gods on thrones may have been most
                  familiar to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> from the synod of the gods in book 15 of <span class="persName">Homer</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Iliad</span></span>, which he knew in <span class="persName">Pope</span>ʼs translation. After <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> (Zeus) has rebuked <span class="persName">Juno</span> (Hera) for assisting the <span class="orgName">Trojans</span>, <span class="persName">Juno</span> provokes <span class="persName">Mars</span> (Ares) to resentful rage for the loss of his son, <span class="persName">Ascalaphus</span>. <span class="persName">Minerva</span> (Athena) “[s]tarts from her azure throne to calm the god”, reminding him of the futility

                  the rising groan” (bk. 15, lines 141, 160–61). This passage also pertains to the association
                  of <span class="persName">Mars</span> and <span class="persName">Venus</span> (Aphrodite), <span class="persName">Juno</span> having conspired with <span class="persName">Venus</span> in book 14 to distract <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> from the battlefield with love‐making and sleep (<span class="persName">Homer</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Iliad</span></span>, trans. <span class="persName">Pope</span>, 307, and see 303–7, 292–97).

               <p>Turning back from a planet to the constellations, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> begins with the largest northern circumpolar constellation, <span class="name">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</span>, which contains the oblong configuration of four stars also known as the <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Plough</span></span> or <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Charlesʼs Wain</span></span>, with another three stars forming its “team” of horses. Considered as part of the
                  larger constellation, the seven stars “form a quadrilateral figure in the back of
                  the Bear; the other three stars project from one of the angles in a curved line, and
                  constitute the tail”; however, the seven stars “occupy but a small part of the whole
                  constellation, which is one of the most extensive in the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 23).</p>

                  As <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Tutor</span> explains, “if you wish to be a young astronomer”, a youth “must learn to find these
                  [cardinal compass] points without the assistance of the <span class="name">sun</span>”; and he directs their eyes to “those seven stars which are in the constellation
                  of the <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Great Bear</span></span>”, which “some people have supposed . . . aptly represent a <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">plough</span></span>; others say, that they are more like a <span style="font-style:italic">waggon and horses;</span>—the four stars representing the body of the waggon, and the other three the horses”

The best‐known story in western classical poetry about the <span class="name">Great Bear</span> is told by <span class="persName">Ovid</span> in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Metamorphoses</span></span>.

               <p>In <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs summary of the legend, “<span class="persName">Medusa</span> was one of the three Gorgons who had the power to turn into stones all those on whom
                  they fixed their eyes; <span class="persName">Medusa</span> was the only one subject to mortality: she was celebrated for the beauty of her locks,
                  but having violated the sanctity of the temple of <span class="persName">Minerva [Athena]</span>, that goddess changed her locks into serpents”. When the hero <span class="persName">Perseus</span> was charged by an envious king to slay the Gorgons, “<span class="persName">Pluto [Hades]</span>, the god of the infernal regions, lent him his helmet, which had the power of rendering
                  its bearer invisible; <span class="persName">Minerva</span>, the goddess of wisdom, furnished him with her buckler, which was resplendent as
                  glass; and he received from <span class="persName">Mercury</span> wings and a dagger, or sword; thus equipped, he cut off the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>, and from the blood which dropped from it in its passage through the air, sprang
                  an innumerable quantity of serpents, which ever after infested the sandy deserts of
                  <span class="placeName">Libya</span>”. On his return from this victory, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> found a maiden, <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>—represented by a constellation adjacent to <span class="name">Perseus</span>—who was “chained naked to a rock . . . to be devoured by a sea monster, in order
                  that her father <span class="persName">Cepheus</span> might still preserve his kingdom. <span class="persName">Perseus</span> turned the monster into a rock by shewing it the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>, and thus rescued <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>, whom he immediately took to wife, as the reward of her patriotism and filial piety”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 19–20).</p> 
               <p>In the first fair copy of his poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> scored through <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> perhaps because the legend was deemed too gruesome for the Ruskin household. In illustrations
                  of <span class="name">Perseus et Caput Medusae</span> from the <span class="date">1820s</span>, <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs artist tempers the horror by representing <span class="name">Perseus</span> holding the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span> by her human hair, from which only a few serpents protrude, and the artist gives
                  her face a mild expression. In contrast, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Perseus</span> grips the head by its mass of writing serpents, and its face is fixed in its dangerous
                  gaze. The effect was not moderated when the plate was adapted for <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, in which <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs glare is even more sinister (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, pl. 4; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, pl. 3; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHURANIASMIRROR"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem">“Uraniaʼs Mirror”</span></a>, pl. 6).</p> 
               <p>To replace <span class="name">Caput Medusae</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> did not immediately shift his attention to the larger constellation, <span class="name">Perseus</span>, which appears later in the poem. Yet even there, the <span class="persName">Gorgon</span> seems to haunt the poem, since <span class="persName">Perseus</span> is listed later in combination with <span class="name">Pegasus</span>, which, according to legend, sprang from <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs body when slain by <span class="persName">Perseus</span>.

               <p>Here, in place of <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> turned to a nearby northern constellation, <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii (<span class="persName">Herschel</span>ʼs Telescope)</span>, which was a comparatively recent creaton, and which suggested the modernity of science
                  rather than ancient blood feuds. This constellation is now obsolete, but, in the <span class="date">first half of the 1820s</span>, it was acknowledged by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="persName">Aspin</span>, and <span class="persName">Green</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 22; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 105, 117–18; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 33).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii</span> was created in <span class="date">1789</span> by the Hungarian astronomer, <span class="persName">Maximilian Hell</span> (<span class="date">1720–92</span>), who devised it from “a few of the stars of <span class="name">Auriga [the Charioteer]</span>. . . . It is intended to perpetuate the name of <span class="persName">Herschell [William Herschel, <span class="date">1738–1822</span>]</span> and the form of the instrument by which he discovered the planet <span class="name">Uranus</span> in the year <span class="date">1781</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 33). It is bounded on the north and east by <span class="name">Lynx</span>, on the south by <span class="name">Gemini</span>, and on the west by <span class="name">Auriga</span>. It appears “always above the horizon of <span class="placeName">London</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 105, 118).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains that <span class="persName">Hell</span> originally created two constellations commemorating <span class="persName">Herschel</span> telescopes, which were reduced to one by <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span> in <span class="date">1801</span>. <span class="persName">Barentine</span> adds that <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs adoption was decisive, few atlases having previously adopted Hellʼs inventions.
                  <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> must therefore have influenced <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs unidentified source for him to have named the constellation at all—an influence
                  that is confirmed by similar clues noted throughout these glosses. A caveat is <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs omission of <span class="persName">Herschel</span>ʼs name, which opens the possibility that he intended, not <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii</span>, but <span class="name">Telescopium (Telescope)</span>—a small constellation in the southern hemisphere. This Telescope, which remains officially
                  recognized today, was created by the French astronomer, <span class="persName">Nicolas‐Louis de Lacaille</span> (<span class="date">1713–62</span>). While <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs intention cannot be proved, it is reasonable to assume that he meant to celebrate
                  a constellation honoring a famous British astronomer, and not an invention by a French
                  astronomer, which lies too deep in the southern hemisphere even to be viewable from
                  <span class="placeName">Britain</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 205–6, 167–68; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 404).</p>

Viewed from <span class="placeName">London</span>, it rose “with <span class="name">Cerberus</span>” and was “visible about the same time”—i.e., “in the evening from May to December”

               <p><span class="name">Vulcepula et Anser</span> was introduced by the Polish astronomer, <span class="persName">Johannes Hevelius</span> (<span class="date">1611–87</span>), who depicted it as a fox with a goose captured in its jaws. The haplessness of
                  the bird may account for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs epithet of “stupid”, but by dividing the constellation in two <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also avoids drawing attention to the gooseʼs fate. A precedent for separating the
                  fox from the goose extends back to <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> himself, who named the constellation both as a single entity, <span class="name">Vulpecula <span style="font-style:italic">cum</span> Anser</span>, and as two distinct entities, which were afterward sometimes reunited as <span class="name">Vulpecula <span style="font-style:italic">et</span> Anser</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 182–83). <span class="persName">Barentine</span> remarks that, in the century following <span class="persName">Hevelius</span>ʼs invention, <span class="name">Anser</span> and <span class="name">Vulpecula</span> were frequently labeled separately, as if they were distinct constellations, but
                  they were reunited as <span class="name">Vulpecula et Anser</span> from the time of <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> (<span class="date">1801</span>) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 37). Since, in other evidence, <span class="persName">Bode</span> appears as a terminus a quo for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs likely sources of information about the constellations (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MUSCAGLOSS" title="the little fly (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Probably referring to Musca Borealis (the Northern Fly) northern constellation now obsolete..."><span class="name">Musca Borealis [the Northern Fly]</span></a>), it is likelier that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> separated <span class="name">Anser</span> from <span class="name">Vulpecula</span> in his poem because he desired to do so, rather than because his source presented
                  them as distinct constellations.</p> 
               <p>Perhaps a predatory and carnivorous fox offended nineteenth‐century sensibility, since
                  both <span class="persName">Aspin</span> and <span class="persName">Green</span> omit any mention of what is happening to the goose. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> not only separates the constellations, but also places <span class="name">Lepus (the Hare)</span> between them. If he intended to shield the <span class="name">goose</span> from the <span class="name">fox</span>, however, he undercut the effort by giving the <span class="name">hare</span> the epithet “timid” (“frightened” in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>). Similarly, his epithet for the <span class="name">goose</span>, “stupid”, robs the disadvantaged of sympathy, just as an implied parallel between
                  the <span class="name">Goose</span> and <span class="name">Medusa</span> and between the <span class="name">Fox</span> and <span class="name">Perseus</span> suggests a justified fate.

               <p><span class="name">Crux</span> is made up of “four fine stars near the hind feet of the <span class="name">Centaur [Centaurus]</span>, . . . which are among the most brilliant in southern latitudes” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 102).

               <p>The stars of the <span class="name">Southern Cross</span> were known to <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>, but he considered them as part of <span class="name">Centaurus</span> in his catalogue of forty‐eight constellations. As <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, although visible to the ancient Mediterranean world, the stars were lost
                  to view in the north owing to precession in the <span class="name">Earth</span>ʼs rotational axis. For Europeans, the stars were rediscovered and charted by explorers
                  sailing south in the <span class="date">sixteenth century</span>, and <span class="name">Crux</span> came to be used by navigators since its axis points to the <span class="geogName">South Pole</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 84–85).

               <p>Of the three southern constellations that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> sequentially names—<span class="name">Crux</span>, <span class="name">Robur Carolinum</span>, and <span class="name">Crater</span>—only the last is visible from <span class="placeName">London</span>. While <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs inclusion of the first two can be attributed to his piety and a sentiment for British

               <p>According to a myth that connects <span class="name">Crater</span> with nearby <span class="name">Corvus</span> and <span class="name">Hydra</span>, <span class="persName">Apollo</span> gave the Cup to <span class="name">Corvus (Crow)</span> to fetch water.

Detecting the lie, <span class="persName">Apollo</span> tossed the <span class="name">Cup</span>, the <span class="name">Water‐serpent</span>, and <span class="name">Crow</span> into the heavens, where <span class="name">Hydra</span> perpetually prevents <span class="name">Crow</span> from drinking from the vessel (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span></a>, 152; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 82–83).</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> remarks that this ancient constellation was known to the poet <span class="persName">Aratus</span> only as <span style="font-style:italic">the kneeling one</span>, and that he was identified belatedly with <span class="persName">Heracles</span> by <span class="persName">Eratosthenes</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 101). This evolution, as <span class="persName">Barentine</span> explains, represents the Mesopotamian origin of the constellation and its appropriation
                  by Greek mythographers who identified the figure with <span class="persName">Heracles</span> and the stories of his twelve labors. European cartographers, from the Renaissance
                  onward, adorned the figure with attributes representing the stories of his labors

               <p>In the <span class="date">1820s</span>, <span class="persName">Green</span> described these emblems, happening to list them in the opposite order in which they
                  had accrued chronologically to the figure in the <span class="date">sixteenth and seventeenth centuries</span>. <span class="persName">Green</span> also conveys how the emblems had become moralized: “It is stated by the mythologists,
                  that [<span class="persName">Hercules</span>] brought upon <span class="name">earth</span> the three‐headed monster <span class="name">Cerberus</span>, which guarded the entrance to <span class="persName">Pluto</span>ʼs dominions. The victory which he obtained over <span class="name">Cerberus</span>, is thought by some to denote his control over his bad passions; for he is held out
                  by the ancients as a pattern of virtue and piety. His judicious choice of virtue,
                  in preference to pleasure, is admirably described by <span class="persName">Xenophon</span>”. <span class="persName">Hercules</span> also grasps the “Hesperidian branch, bearing the golden apples”, a story that “is

Also, “the skin of a <span class="name">lion</span> covers his head and shoulders.

               <p>The constellation <span class="name">Cerberus</span> was created in <span class="date">1687</span> by <span class="persName">Johannes Hevelius</span>, based on the Greek myth of the hound that guards the entrance to <span class="placeName">Hades</span>. <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> placed the creature in the grip of <span class="name">Hercules</span>ʼs hand, as the quarry of the heroʼs twelth labor, in which he was charged to capture
                  the beast and bring it back alive from the underworld. <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> represented the creature only by its three serpent necks with dogʼs heads (more reptilian
                  than canine, as pictured in <span class="persName">Hevelius</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Prodromus Astronomiae</span></span>) but omitted its body. <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> designed the writhing triple‐necked beast to displace the <span class="name">triple‐stalked branch of the Hesperidian golden apples</span>, which <span class="persName">Johannes Bayer</span> had placed in <span class="persName">Hercules</span>ʼs grip in <span class="date">1603</span>, in his <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranometria</span></span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 101–4; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 190). Thus capping <span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs idea for an additional attribute to assign to the constellation <span class="name">Hercules</span>, <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> also capped his predecessorʼs allusion to the heroʼs labors, by moving on from the
                  eleventh labor, stealing the golden apples from the <span class="placeName">Garden of the Hesperides</span>, to the twelfth, capturing and abducting Cerberus from the gates of the <span class="placeName">underworld</span>.</p> 
               <p>While it is unsurprising that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> identifies <span class="name">Cerberus</span> separately from the constellation <span class="name">Hercules</span>, just as he divides other conjoined constellations, his isolation of <span class="name">Cerberus</span> from its sometimes companion, sometimes rival, <span class="name">Ramus Pomifer</span> poses some inconsistency with the case for his source, which so far has been tied
                  to an ancestry that includes <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span>. <span class="persName">Barentine</span> notes that, after <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> thrust <span class="name">Cerberus</span> into the place of <span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs <span class="name">Ramus Pomifer</span>, there ensued “a dispute among cartographers”—some siding with the infernal beast,
                  others with the paradisical apples. The contest “persist[ed] until the eventual extinction
                  of . . . [the <span class="name">Cerberus constellation</span>] in the <span class="date">late nineteenth century</span>”.

               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains that the name “probably comes from a Greek word meaning ‘noisy’ or ‘clamorous’,
                  referring to the herdsmanʼs shouts to his animals”; or, linking the etymology to <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> inside <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, the name is a word “from the ancient Greek meaning ‘ox‐driver’”. According to a
                  legend in <span class="persName">Eratosthenes</span> similar to a story associated with Ursa Minor, the constellation “represents <span class="persName">Arcas</span>, son of the god <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and his paramour <span class="persName">Callisto</span>, daughter of <span class="persName">King Lycaon</span> of <span class="placeName">Arcadia</span>”.

                  . . . <span class="persName">Zeus</span> snatched up <span class="persName">Arcas</span> and his mother and placed them in the sky as the constellations of the bear‐keeper
                  and the bear” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 53).</p> 
               <p>In <span class="date">1822</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> likewise noted that <span class="name">Boötes</span> is pulled toward conflicting identities. As <span class="persName">Arcas</span> the hunter, he “appears in a walking posture, grasping in his right hand a spear,
                  and having his left extended upwards, holding the leash of the dogs Asterion and Chara
                  <span class="name">[Canes Venatici]</span>, which seem to be barking at the <span class="name">Great Bear</span>”.

               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears to have returned to the southern hemisphere of constellations, drawn again
                  seemingly by British sentiment (see also <a class="link_ref" href="#CRUXGLOSS" title="the blessed cross (RF T70 MS III)Unless Ruskin mistook as a separate constellation what is often called the Cross or Northern C..."><span class="name">Crux [the Southern Cross]</span></a> and <span class="name">Robur Carolinum [Charlesʼs Oak]</span>). In this case, however, the identification of his sentiment with an English name,
                  the <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span>, puts in doubt what constellation he intended. The name “swallow” appears in the
                  first draft, <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, and in the fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>. In the latter, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> struck through the name and substituted “sweet hirundo” (<span style="font-style:italic">hirundo</span> is the Latin name for the species including swallows), which he carried over to the
                  final fair copy, <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. Neither of these names, <span style="font-style:italic">swallow</span> nor <span style="font-style:italic">hirundo</span>, is used either in todayʼs star charts or in <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs chart published in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs time.</p> 
               <p>The names <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo</span> did have currency, a constellation called “Hirundo, the Swallow” appearing, e.g.,
                  in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</span> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>). It is listed under the heading “The New Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”,
                  before <span class="name">“Grus, the Crane”</span> and after <span class="name">“Indus, the Indian”</span>, although the ordering of constellation names in <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs columns may not be significant (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Sherwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy</span></span></a>, 17). According to <span class="persName">Richard Hinckley Allen</span>, the constellation <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> may have acquired the name the <span style="font-style:italic">Swallow</span> by way of the common English name for <span class="persName">Linnaeus</span>ʼs species name, <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo apus</span>, which is also applied to the swift‐birds associated with the approach of summer
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALLENSTARNAMES"><span class="persName">Allen</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Names</span></span></a>, 44). As a gloss for <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs listing, however, <span class="persName">Allen</span>ʼs explanation is contradicted by her <span style="font-style:italic">separate</span> listing of <span class="name">“Apus, or Avis Indica, the Bird of Paradise”</span>, which appears at the end of the list, following <span class="name">“Triangulum Australe, the Southern Triangle”</span>. If <span class="persName">Allen</span> is correct that <span style="font-style:italic">Hirundo apus</span> became confused with the constellation name, <span class="name">Apus</span>, it is understandable that <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> would nonetheless have decided that a constellation named after the common English
                  <span class="name">swallow</span> could be the same constellation known as <span class="name">Apus</span> or <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus Indica</span></span> or (in English) <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Bird of Paradise</span></span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 63, pl. 28). A probable conclusion, then, is that <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> doubled the same constellation under two different names, and that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, insofar as he understood what he meant at all, was pointing to <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> in the southern hemisphere.</p> 
               <p>The constellation <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus, or Apus Indica</span></span>, which is associated with the family of exotic birds commonly known as <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">birds of paradise</span></span>, was one among twelve southern constellations introduced to European sky charts in
                  the <span class="date">late sixteenth century</span>, based on observations of the sky south of the equator by the Dutch navigators, <span class="persName">Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser</span> and <span class="persName">Frederick de Houtman</span>. The name <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Apus</span></span> was derived from the Greek for <span style="font-style:italic">without foot</span>, since, as <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, specimens originally obtained from <span class="placeName">New Guinea</span> by Europeans were skins from which the birdsʼ feet had been removed, leading to speculation
                  that these fabulous birds, with their long and colorful plummage, remained permanently
                  in flight (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 41).</p>

               <p><span class="name">Lynx</span> was invented by <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> in <span class="date">1687</span>, using stars left by the ancients from the surrounding constellations; thus, the

Intentionally or not, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs choice of the epithet “keen‐eyed” is pertinent not only to the animal but also
                  the constellationʼs inventor, who is said to have chosen the <span class="name">lynx</span> as a glorification of his own eyesight. At a time when astronomy was becoming defined
                  by its optical instruments, <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> persisted in relying on his unassisted eyesight. “Anyone who wanted to observe” his
                  new constellation, he wrote, “would need the eyesight of a <span class="name">lynx</span>”, Yet the “unformed” stars (i.e., stars not formed into a constellation) from which
                  <span class="name">Lynx</span> was made, which lay outside of the <span class="name">Great Bear</span>, had been spotted and listed by <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 119–20). Unimpressed, <span class="persName">Green</span> considered <span class="name">Lynx</span> “a very uninteresting constellation” and wondered “why a <span class="name">Lynx</span> should have been chosen to represent this cluster of stars, rather than any other
                  animal” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 32).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs revision of <span class="name">Lynx</span>ʼs epithet from “furious” to “keeneyed” may have been influenced by the fable, <span class="titlem">“The Lynx and the Mole”</span>, from <span class="persName">William Godwin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fables Ancient and Modern</span></span>. The tale begins by listing several attributes associated with the lynx, both natural
                  and fabulous, but “what is most remarkable about him is his sight. He discovers objects
                  at a greater distance than any other animal in the world. The ancients said, he could
                  see through stone walls”. In the tale, a lynx belittles a mole for its weak vision,
                  boasting “thou must needs burst with envy and rage against the partiality of nature,
                  which has assigned thee such a wretched existence”. The mole answers: “If nature has
                  denied me some organs and beauties which you possess, she has endowed me with what
                  is better than both, a cheerful temper, enabling me to support my obscure existence,
                  without misery or murmuring”. While contentment with oneʼs lot seems the moral of
                  the tale, <span class="persName">Godwin</span> allows the mole to triumph over the lynx: “if you surpass me in some of the senses”,
                  the mole points out to the lynx, “I am equally superior to you in others”—specifically,
                  his sharp hearing, which enables the mole to detect the advance of a hunter, unnoticed
                  by the lynx. Caught by surprise, the lynx is mortally wounded by the hunterʼs javelin;
                  and as the mole listens to the “lynxʼs expiring agony”, the narrator swerves the mole
                  away from schadenfreude and back to complacency: he “felt more than ever thankful
                  to Providence, for having blessed him with a mind not to repine at his station” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GODWINFABLES"><span class="persName">Butler [pseud.

In <span class="placeName">London</span>, <span class="name">Leo</span> “rises in the E.N.E. and may be viewed in the evenings of January to May”, according
                  to <span class="persName">Aspin</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 106, 135). Listed by <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span> among the forty‐eight constellations in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Almagest</span></span>.</p> 
               <p>As a trio of <span class="name">Zodiac</span> signs sequentially named by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, <span class="name">Lynx</span>, <span class="name">Scorpio</span>, and <span class="name">Leo</span> seem connected mainly by the ferocity of the beasts they represent. As <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> comments regarding <span class="name">Leo</span>, “[p]opular tradition represents the <span class="name">Lion</span>, an animal remarkable for his fierceness and strength, as emblematical of the <span class="name">Sun</span>ʼs heat at this period of the year”, advanced summer. The <span class="name">sun</span> enters <span class="name">Leo</span> on July 23 (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 40). <span class="persName">Aspin</span> points out that, “chiefly situated north of the ecliptic”, it “passes over the countries
                  situated in the north part of the torrid zone, where lions are generally found” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 135).</p> 
               <p>Mythologically, <span class="name">Leo</span> is associated with the terrible <span class="name">Lion of <span class="placeName">Nemea</span></span>, which <span class="persName">Hercules</span> defeated as the first of his twelve labors. After <span class="persName">Hercules</span> was successful, he made a cloak of the Lionʼs skin, which was said to be impervious
                  to weapons, and the lionʼs head of the cloak rested atop <span class="persName">Hercules</span>ʼs own head (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 112). In his <span class="titlem">plate 8</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> shows <span class="persName">Hercules</span> with this cloak, capped by the lionʼs head.</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first epithet, “king”, as drafted in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, is appropriate to <span class="name">Leo</span>ʼs heraldic as well as mythological associations. The lion is a royal emblem of England
                  as the unicorn is an emblem of Scotland, the two joined in the royal arms of Great
                  Britain (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MONOCEROSGLOSS" title="unicorn (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Monoceros (the Unicorn) southern constellation bounded (as reckoned in the 1820s prior to obsolesc..."><span class="name">Monceros (the Unicorn)</span></a>).</p> 
               <p>In revising the first fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substituted for “king” the epithet “generous”, which he fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. This epithet is the keynote of the fable, <span class="titlem">“The Lion and the Mouse”</span>, in which a lion, who spares the life of a mouse, is repaid in kind when the mouse
                  rescues the lion from a hunterʼs net by chewing through the cords.</p> 
               <p>In the version of the fable translated in the eighteenth century by <span class="persName">Samuel Croxall</span>, in an edition that was owned by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs father, the noun “Generosity” is applied to the lion only once—and only in the
                  moral “Application” of the fable (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CROXALLAESOP"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fables of Aesop and Others</span></span>, trans. <span class="persName">Croxall</span></a>, 57). In a more modern adaptation of the story in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fables Ancient and Modern, Adapted for the Use of Children</span> (<span class="date">1805</span>)</span>, by <span class="persName">Edward Baldwin (pseud. William Godwin)</span>, in an edition that was likely acquired for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, the modifier used here in <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">generous</span>, appears along with <span style="font-style:italic">generously</span> twice in the fable itself (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GODWINFABLES"><span class="persName">Baldwin [pseud. Godwin]</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fables Ancient and Modern</span></span></a>, 44, 46; see <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#UNTRACED">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth—Physical Descriptions: Untraced Books</a>). In <span class="persName">Godwin</span>ʼs version, moreover, the story takes on what <span class="persName">Pamela Clemit</span> characterizes as <span class="persName">Godwin</span>ʼs “egalitarian spin” on <span class="persName">Aesop</span>ʼs fables. Moreover, in <span class="persName">Godwin</span>ʼs conversational narrative style, unlike in <span class="persName">Croxall</span>ʼs rigid lecturing, the “moral is drawn not through a traditional application” but
                  is conveyed “through action and dialogue” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CLEMITGODWINSJUVENILELIBRARY"><span class="persName">Clemit</span>, <span class="titlem">“William Godwinʼs Juvenile Library”</span></a>, 94).</p> 
               <p>Thus, in <span class="persName">Croxall</span>ʼs “application” of <span class="titlem">“The Lion and Mouse”</span>, the fable is interpreted as upholding a traditional social hierarchy, reminding
                  “us” along with the lion that, “as the lowest People in Life may, upon Occasion, have
                  it in their Power either to serve or hurt us”, such circumstances as befell the lion
                  teach us “our Duty, in Point of common Interest, to behave ourselves with Good‐nature
                  and Lenity towards all with whom we have to do”, ensuring that a low person may “not
                  only . . . repay, but even . . . exceed, the Obligation due to his Benefactor” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CROXALLAESOP"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fables of Aesop and Others</span></span>, trans. <span class="persName">Croxall</span></a>, 57). In contrast, <span class="persName">Godwin</span>ʼs version contains no formal application reversing the role of the lion from victim
                  to “Benefactor” whose “Generosity” consists in dispensing noblesse oblige. Instead,
                  the lion “is said to be very generous” by nature; for although he is “so formed that
                  he must have meat to eat, . . . he never kills any creature for sport or cruelty”.
                  When the mouse inadvertently disturbs the lion, the roused beast relents, not because
                  he calculates leniency as a duty “in point of common Interest”, but because his nature
                  is sympathic rather than cruel: “he could not find it in his heart to hurt such a
                  poor little fellow”. Thus, when the lion is caught in a net—a predicament that arises,
                  not in the course of timeless, mythic circumstances, but in the specific context of
                  modern <span class="placeName">Britain</span>, when “some sailors”, to curry favor, “wanted to catch a lion for <span class="persName">king George</span>, to be put into the <span class="placeName">Tower of London</span>”—the lion feels what the mouse had experienced. Unlike <span class="persName">Croxall</span>ʼs kingly beast, <span class="persName">Godwin</span>ʼs lion is admitted to be “full as much frightened as the mouse had been the other
                  day”, so that his generosity arises from fellow feeling rather than noblesse oblige
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GODWINFABLES"><span class="persName">Baldwin [pseud. Godwin]</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fables Ancient and Modern</span></span></a>, 44, 45).</p> 
               <p>If naming <span class="name">Leo</span> became for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> a lesson in sympathy, the constellation was for <span class="persName">Green</span> a subject of religious controversy. He uses the constellation to highlight the <span class="titlem">Zodiac of Dendera</span>, an artifact discovered in the 1790s during <span class="persName">Napoleon</span>ʼs campaign in <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>, and brought to <span class="placeName">Paris</span> to be installed in the <span class="placeName">Louvre</span> in <span class="date">1822</span>. <span class="persName">Green</span> notes that the constellations carved on the disk start from <span class="name">Leo</span>, rather than from <span class="name">Aries</span>, normally treated as the first sign of the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> owing to its association with the vernal equinox. Writing on the constellation <span class="name">Aries</span>, <span class="persName">Green</span> is skeptical of “those who are desirous of drawing from every source an argument
                  against the chronology of the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, that these <span class="name">zodiacs</span> were constructed when the <span class="name">sun</span> entered the sign <span class="name">Leo</span>, which must have been more than ten thousand years before the birth of our <span class="persName">Saviour</span>”. In his skepticism about the challenges that archaeology poses to literal interpretation
                  of Scripture, <span class="persName">Green</span> aligns himself with the views of <span class="persName">Thomas Chalmers</span> (<span class="date">1780–1847</span>): “There are, perhaps, no opinions more diametrically opposed to each other, than
                  those of theorizing antiquaries. On almost every important question the contending
                  parties, in point of numbers and reputation, neutralize themselves; and what <span class="persName">Dr. Chalmers</span> has said in his <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evidences of Christianity</span></span> relative to speculating geologists, may justly be applied to them. ‘Though our imaginations
                  have been regaled by the brilliancy of their speculations, they are so opposite to
                  each other, that we now cease to be impressed by their evidence’” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 76, 64–65).</p> 
               <p>In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Discourses on the Christian Revelation Viewed in Connection with the Modern Astronomy</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>), <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> sought to refute skeptical arguments that the evidence of astronomy undermines the
                  truth of Christian revelation. A copy of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Discourses</span></span> was in the Ruskin family library (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 67 [no. 473]). <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> instead proposes, according to <span class="persName">David Cairns</span>, “such a relevance between the knowledge which the sciences present to us”—even the
                  presentiment by modern astronomy of a forbiddingly vast and violent universe—and the
                  convictions of faith that, in <span class="persName">Cairns</span>ʼs estimation, the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Discourses</span></span> constitute a natural theology (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CAIRNSCHALMERSASTRONOMICAL"><span class="titlem">“Thomas Chalmersʼ Astronomical Discourses”</span></a>, 417).</p> 
               <p>While an academic scientist like <span class="persName">Green</span> could align himself with a natural theology as articulated by <span class="persName">Chalmers</span>, evangelicals—especially Scottish evangelicals, like <span class="persName">Chalmers</span>—were not receptive to a natural theology in the optimistic style presented by <span class="persName">William Paley (<span class="date">1743–1805</span>)</span>. As <span class="persName">Jonathan R. Topham</span> argues, while many evangelicals remained open to a “theology of nature” that advocated
                  “a rational religion that would attract the cultured middle classes”, they maintained “a scriptural and soteriological emphasis distinct from the largely ethical emphasis” of
                  Paleyan natural theology, with its evidences of a <span class="persName">Creator</span> conceived as a benevolent watchmaker. <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> himself arrived at this emphasis following a transformative conversion experience,
                  which resulted in an essay widely disseminated in <span class="date">1814</span> as <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evidence and Authority of the Christian Revelation</span></span>—the text mentioned by <span class="persName">Green</span> as his lodestar. In it, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> pursues an inductive Baconian “science of theology . . . based strictly on historical evidence. 
                  This comprised chiefly the ‘external evidence’ of the truth of the Christian revelation (the miracles and prophecies attending it), 
                  but also included . . . the ‘internal evidence’, namely the ‘marks of truth’ in the <span class="titlem">New Testament</span> considered as a human composition,  and the evidence provided by the text as to the character of its authors. These inferences were sound, he argued, since they were based on observations of human nature, of which people have much empirical experience”.
                  By comparison, <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> considered a Paleyan natural theology that judged “the truth of <span class="orgName">Christianity</span> on the reasonableness of its doctrines,  or any supposed agreement between the nature of the Christian religion and the character of the supreme being”
                  to be reliant  “on a priori speculation, and . . . consequently strictly anti‐Baconian and unscientific”.
                  We have “no experience whatever” of the “invisible <span class="persName">God</span>”, he argued, and his government must consequently be a subject “inaccessible to our faculties”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#TOPHAMCHALMERS"><span class="persName">Topham</span>, <span class="titlem">“Science, Natural Theology, and Evangelicalism in Early Nineteenth‐Century Scotland”</span></a>, 144, 149, 155).</p>

                  <span class="persName">Chalmers</span> concludes, the “sense of wonder engendered by contemplation of the astonishing phenomena of astronomy had no power to impel .

               <p>The constellation was invented in <span class="date">1612</span> by a Dutch theologian and astronomer, <span class="persName">Petrus Plancius</span>, who used the giraffeʼs outline to fill a space left blank by ancient astronomers
                  because of the dimness of the stars (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 56–57). At that time, the <span class="name">giraffe</span> was a semi‐mythical creature, which was imagined on the basis of a description by
                  <span class="persName">Pliny the Elder</span> in his <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Natural History</span></span> (77 AD) as combining the frame of a camel with the skin of a leopard—hence the name,
                  <span style="font-style:italic">camelopardalis</span>. Since sightings of the animal by Europeans remained rare, <span class="persName">Pliny</span>ʼs description influenced illustrators as late as <span class="persName">Thomas Bewick</span> in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A General History of Quadrupeds</span></span> (<span class="date">1790</span>) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ITOLONDONZOO"><span class="persName">Ito</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">London Zoo and the Victorians</span></span></a>, 55–60). In <span class="date">1825</span>, <span class="persName">Aspin</span> played it safe with a description allowing for a wide berth: “an Abyssinian animal,
                  taller than the elephant, but not so thick” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 111).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> attempts no descriptive epithet, but his choice of the constellation may have been
                  influenced by the spectacle of the first living specimen of giraffe in <span class="placeName">Britain</span>, which was brought shortly prior to the period when he began composing the poem.
                  In <span class="date">summer 1827</span>, two young giraffes were sent to <span class="geogName">Europe</span>, one to <span class="persName">King George IV</span> of <span class="placeName">Great Britain</span> and the other to <span class="persName">King Charles X</span> of <span class="placeName">France</span>, as diplomatic gifts from <span class="persName">Mehmed (Muhammad) Ali</span>, the Pasha of <span class="placeName">Egypt</span>. (In <span class="date">1828</span>, a third giraffe arrived in <span class="placeName">Vienna</span>, as a gift to <span class="persName">Emperor Francis I</span> of <span class="placeName">Austria</span>.) While the British specimen was kept out of view from the public, in the <span class="placeName">Royal Menagerie</span> at <span class="placeName">Windsor Great Park</span>, an engraving of the animal “taken from life” with its attendants in Arabian costume
                  was published in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Literary Gazette</span></span> with an account of the specimenʼs “differences from those” physical attributes “described
                  by preceding naturalists” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ITOLONDONZOO"><span class="persName">Ito</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">London Zoo and the Victorians</span></span></a>, 61; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CAMELOPARDALISLITGAZETTE1827"><span class="titlem">“The Camelopardalis, or Giraffe”</span></a>, 554, 553). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs awareness of the sensation cannot be proved directly; however, he notably does
                  not use the Latinate spelling, <span style="font-style:italic">camelopardalis</span>, which was normally applied to the constellation (e.g., by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="persName">Aspin</span>, and <span class="persName">Green</span>), but rather the English derivation, <span style="font-style:italic">camelopard</span>, which was used for the animal (e.g., by the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Literary Gazette</span></span>). (In <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> spells the constellation as <span style="font-style:italic">cameleopard</span>, but in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, he omits the first <span style="font-style:italic">e</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">camleopard</span>; see “camelopard, n.1”, <span style="font-style:italic">OED Online</span>, accessed <span class="date">15 May 2023</span>; see also <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 26; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 21).</p> 
               <p>The British kingʼs giraffe died in <span class="date">1829</span>, a cause of considerable chagrin since the French‐acquired specimen continued to
                  thrive for eighteen years in the <span class="placeName">Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes</span> in <span class="placeName">Paris</span>. Therefore, importation of four giraffes to the <span class="placeName">London Zoo</span> in <span class="date">1836</span>, outnumbering the one exhibited in the French exhibition, caused an outpouring of
                  pride and curiosity. The reaction is explained by <span class="persName">Takashi Ito</span> in context of perceived anxiety over the lagging progress of British science and
                  scientific institutions, among other factors (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ITOLONDONZOO"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">London Zoo and the Victorians</span></span></a>, 63–71).</p>

               <p>As <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, two constellations named <span style="font-style:italic">Musca</span> existed for a time, one in the southern hemisphere and one in the northern hemisphere.
                  The earlier claim belonged to the southern constellation, situated immediately south

Soon thereafter, the northern constellation emerged in <span class="date">seventeenth‐century</span> atlases, but its origin is obscure and has been credited to various astronomers,
                  each of whom had his own idea of what kind of insect was figured by the four stars
                  above <span class="name">Aries</span>. <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> and <span class="persName">Barentine</span> each list several identities that were bestowed on the constellation, including Vespa
                  (the Wasp); Apis, also Apes (the Bee); <span class="name">Musca (the Fly)</span>;  the Dutch word for <span style="font-style:italic">fly</span>, De Vlieghe;  and the Greek word for <span style="font-style:italic">fly</span>, Muia  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 126–27; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 239–41).</p> 
               <p>Naming the northern constellation <span style="font-style:italic">Musca</span>, as <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> did in <span class="date">1687</span>, especially caused confusion as cartographers sought to distinguish the northern
                  constellation from the southern, which was sometimes called <span class="name">Musca Australis</span>. In the posthumously published <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Atlas Coelestis</span></span> (<span class="date">1729</span>) by the English astronomer, <span class="persName">John Flamsteed</span> (<span class="date">1646–1719</span>), the image of a fly was engraved to identify the four stars above <span class="name">Aries</span> but the figure was left unnamed,  while the name <span style="font-style:italic">Musca</span> was applied to the image of an insect in <span class="persName">Flamsteed</span>ʼs planisphere of the southern hemisphere. Yet, confusingly, while omitting a label
                  to identify the northern insect in the plate devoted to <span class="name">Aries</span>, the atlas did name that image in a planisphere of the northern hemisphere, where
                  it was labeled <span style="font-style:italic">Muica</span>, apparently harkening back to the Grecian <span style="font-style:italic">Muia</span>, <span class="persName">Plancius</span>ʼs name for the southern constellation (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FLAMSTEEDATLASCOELESTIS"><span class="persName">Flamsteed</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Atlas Coelestis</span></span></a>, n.p.; see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 127, and <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHATLASCOELESTIS"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem">“Flamsteedʼs Atlas Coelestis”</span></a>). In the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> (<span class="date">1801</span>) by <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span>, the northern constellation got the name <span style="font-style:italic">Musca</span>, while the southern counterpart was called <span style="font-style:italic"><span class="name">Apis</span></span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BODEURANOGRAPHIA"><span class="persName">Bode</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span></a>, pl. 11, 20). In the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span> (<span class="date">1822</span>), <span class="persName">Alexander Jamieson</span> revised the name of the northern constellation to <span class="name">Musca Borealis</span> in order to distinguish it from <span class="name">Musca Australis</span> in the south—the first atlas to make that distinction, according to <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>—yet this innovation only prompted others to drop <span style="font-style:italic">Australis</span> from the name of the southern constellation, according to <span class="persName">Barentine</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 198–99; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 241–42).</p> 
               <p>The course of these confusions matters since clues may emerge that point to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs source of information about all the constellations. His poem identifies <span class="name">“the little fly”</span> at line 34 and <span class="name">“the armed bee”</span> at line 48. Presumably, therefore, his source distinguished between the northern
                  and the southern constellations, naming one <span class="name">Musca, or the Fly</span>, and the other <span class="name">Apis, or the Bee</span>. This combination suggests a source traceable to <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> or a derivative, thus placing <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs “little fly” in the north and his “armed bee” in the south. While these identifications
                  cannot be confirmed with certainty, given <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs caveat noted in the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy of the poem, that “[t]hese constellations though they are next in this
                  poetry are not next in the sky”, nonetheless the <span class="name">Fly</span> is said to be “next to” <span class="name">Camelopardalis</span>, which is named in line 33, and the <span class="name">Fly</span> is followed by lines on <span class="name">Serpens</span>/<span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> (line 35) and <span class="name">Aries</span> (line 36). <span class="name">Musca Borealis</span> was not directly “next to” <span class="name">Camelopardalis</span> or <span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> in any correct view of the constellations, yet the northern hemisphere is strongly
                  suggested by this sequence of names—especially the nearby mention of <span class="name">Aries</span>—thus clinching the identification of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs Fly with the northern <span class="name">Musca Borealis</span>.</p> 
               <p>From where exactly did <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> derive his names for these constellations? A British source that conformed with <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs identification of the northern <span class="name">Musca (the Fly)</span> and the southern <span class="name">Apis (the Bee)</span> could have been <span class="persName">Alexander Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span> or the derivative <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, the set of thirty‐two constellation cards based on <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs plates, along with the toyʼs accompanying textbook, <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span>.  In <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs plate 13, <span class="titlem">“Aries, and Musca Borealis”</span>, the <span class="name">Fly</span> is illustrated prominently within the border of the <span class="name">Ram</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 35, pl. 13). Adapted for the young audience of <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs plate was imitated as card 16, <span class="titlem">“Aries and Musca Borealis”</span>. (Moreover, the boundaries of <span class="name">“Musca Borealis”</span> are idenified on other cards, as well, in <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>: namely, card 5, <span class="titlem">“Gloria Frederici, Andromeda”</span>, and card 6, <span class="titlem">“Perseus and Caput Medusae”</span>. For images of the cards, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHURANIASMIRROR"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem">“Uraniaʼs Mirror”</span></a>.)</p> 
               <p>If <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and his imitators pinned down <span class="name">Musca</span> in the north, it is less clear how the southern <span class="name">Musca Australis</span> might have figured in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs naming of the <span class="name">“armed bee”</span>. In <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">plate 28</span>, which is a planisphere, the constellation appears as a small figure without an identifying
                  caption, perhaps owing to lack of space. Its image is absent altogether from <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, since the illustrated cards exclude representation of constellations that lie too
                  far south to be viewed by British stargazers. The same exclusions apply to <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs accompanying text, except for tables of the northern and southern constellations,
                  in which the listings play it safe by supplying all the variant names: the northern
                  one is “<span class="name">Apis, <span style="font-style:italic">vel</span> Musca Borealis—The Northern Bee, <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> Fly</span>”, situated north of <span class="name">Aries</span>, and the southern one is “<span class="name">Apis, <span style="font-style:italic">vel</span> Musca Australis—The Southern Bee, <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> Fly</span>”, situated south of <span class="name">Centaurus</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 105, 106, and see 131).</p> 
               <p>While <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and his imitators neglected the illustration of the southern constellation, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> did give <span class="name">Apis</span> its due in the text, as the very last of his prose description of the constellations.
                  Identifying the asterism as <span class="name">“Musca Australis, the Southern Fly, or Bee”</span>, he bestows a royal coloring on the creature, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would have appreciated, given his favoring of constellations with monarchical associations—<a class="link_ref" href="#CHARLESSHEARTGLOSS" title="starry charlesʼs heart (RF T70 MS III)Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart) northern constellation a small asterism consisting of only t..."><span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span></a> in the north, and <a class="link_ref" href="#CHARLESSOAKGLOSS" title="great charlesʼs oak (RF T70 MS III)Robur Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak) southern constellation bounded (as reckoned in the 1820s pri..."><span class="name">Robur Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak)</span></a> in the south. <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, like <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, singles out the apian name for elaboration: “The introduction of the <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Bee</span></span> among the Celestial Host is a pretty idea, as well on account of the natural qualities
                  of this most extraordinary insect, as on account of its being the old hieroglyphic
                  of royalty. Of the insentient part of animated nature, the <span class="name">Bee</span> is prince and chief for foresight, ingenuity, industry, and fidelity: it was thence
                  the fittest symbol of a good king” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 63). If <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was aware of any iconographic associations with the <span class="name">Bee</span> at all, these royal attributes may have been reinforced for him by the proximity
                  of <span class="name">Apis or Musca Australis</span> to <span class="name">Charlesʼs Oak</span>, separated only by <span class="name">Crux</span> and <span class="name">Chameleon</span>.</p> 
               <p>This evidence does not necessarily argue that <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs influence was direct. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> could have derived both of his constellation names from a primer such as <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>, which lists <span class="name">Musca, the Bee, or Fly</span> among “The New Constellations to the North of the Ecliptic”, while including <span class="name">Apis, the Bee</span> among “The New Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”. Published prior to <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span>, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs elementary work does appear, however, to have derived information from <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> or a derivative (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Sherwood</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy</span></span></a>, 15, 16).</p> 
               <p>Whereas <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> lent an iconography of royal virtue to the <span class="name">Southern Bee</span>, the iconographic traditions surrounding <span class="name">Musca Borealis</span>, or the Northern Fly, are darker and more bizarre. In one, the <span class="name">Northern Fly or Bee</span> is connected with the “swarm of bees and honey” that collected “in the carcass of
                  the lion” that <span class="persName">Samson</span> killed with his bare hands when traveling to the Philistine woman he desired for
                  his wife (<span class="titlem">Judg. 14:8</span>; see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 245). According to <span class="persName">Thomas Scott</span>ʼs annotations to this episode in <span class="titlem">Judges</span>, <span class="persName">Samson</span> is a type of “<span class="persName">Jesus Christ</span>, ere he entered upon his public ministry, and on the cross before his ascension”,
                  when he “overcame ‘the devil, that roaring lion, which walketh about seeking whom
                  he may devour’”. From the honey in the lion carcass, <span class="persName">Samson</span> draws a riddle to challenge the Philistines: “Out of the eater came forth meat, and
                  out of the strong came forth sweetness” (<span class="titlem">Judg.</span> 14:14). Typologically, <span class="persName">Scott</span> reads the riddle as signifying the <span class="persName">Lord</span>ʼs providentially turning evil to good: “The victory, which <span class="persName">Christ</span> obtained over <span class="persName">Satan</span>, by means of his agonies and death . . . ; the glory that redounded to the <span class="persName">Father</span>; and the spiritual advantages thence accruing to his people”. <span class="persName">Scott</span> goes on to elaborate these spiritual advantages at length (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="titlem">Holy Bible</span>, ed. <span class="persName">Scott</span></a>, 1:732, 733).</p> 
               <p>In another Christian iconographic connection, the <span class="name">Northern Fly</span> was viewed as an emblem of <span class="persName">Beelzebub</span>, Lord of the flies (e.g., <span class="titlem">Matt. 12:24</span>, <span class="titlem">Luke 11:15</span>; see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 245–48). When <span class="persName">Jesus</span> performed the miracle of causing the blind to see, and the dumb to speak, the Pharisees
                  attributed his power of “cast[ing] out devils” to the aid of “<span class="persName">Beelzebub</span>, the prince of devils” (<span class="titlem">Matt. 12:24</span>)—the name <span class="persName"><span style="font-style:italic">Beelzebub</span></span> signifying <span style="font-style:italic">Lord of a fly</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Lord of a dunghill</span>. <span class="persName">Jesus</span> refutes the claim by arguing: “If <span class="persName">Satan</span> cast out <span class="persName">Satan</span>, he is divided against himself: how shall then his kingdom stand” (<span class="titlem">Matt. 12:26</span>). <span class="persName">Scott</span> interprets the parable similarly to <span class="persName">Samson</span>ʼs riddle, as referring to the self‐thwarting of evil: “If <span class="persName">Satan</span> aided <span class="persName">Jesus</span> in casting out devils, the infernal kingdom was divided against itself; and how then
                  could it any longer subsist?” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="titlem">Holy Bible</span>, ed. <span class="persName">Scott</span></a>, 5:92–93).</p>

                  (first added to the fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and repeated in the second fair copy, <span class="titlem">MS III</span>).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Serpens (Serpent)</span> and <span class="name">Ophiuchus (Serpent Bearer)</span> are recognized as distinct constellations but treated as one by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, Aspin, and <span class="persName">Green</span>. <span class="persName">Green</span> explains: “This constellation is represented by a man grasping a serpent. . . . It
                  is divided into two parts, one of which is assigned to <span class="name">Ophiuchus</span> and the other to <span class="name">Serpens</span>. . . . According to ancient tradition, . . . [the human] figure represents the celebrated

Put another way by <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, the intertwining of <span class="name">Serpent</span> and <span class="name">Serpent Bearer</span> forms “the symbol of medicine, and of the gods who presided over this art”, although
                  he adds naturalistically that “the reptile may also be the symbol of prudence and
                  vigilance” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 29).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span> relates a story explaining the connection between snakes and healing: “On one occasion

                  magically returned to life. <span class="persName">Asclepius</span> took the same herb and laid it on the body of <span class="persName">Glaucus</span>, who too was magically resurrected” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 130).</p>

               <p>As traditionally understood, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> explains, “the <span class="name">Sun</span> enters <span class="name">Aries</span> on the 20th of March being the vernal equinox, the first day of Spring [in the northern
                  hemisphere], and the commencement of the astronomical year. It is then the beginning
                  of day at the <span class="geogName">North Pole</span>, the end of day at the <span class="geogName">South Pole</span>, and at this period the days and nights are equal, all over the globe except at the

The <span class="geogName">North Pole</span> is just coming into the light, and the <span class="name">Sun</span> is vertical to the Equator, which, together with the tropic of <span class="name">Cancer</span>, the parallel of <span class="placeName">London</span>, and the arctic circle, are all equally cut by the circle bounding light and darkness;
                  and hence the equality which reigns in all places in respect to the length of day

               <p>As <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> goes on to explain, however, while “[t]hese are astronomical truths”, “in nature
                  the sign <span class="name">Aries</span> has no part therein” since the precession of the equinoxes has caused the “place”
                  of <span class="name">Aries</span> to be “occupied by <span class="name">Pisces</span>” on the vernal equinox. “More than 2000 years have passed away since the sign Aries,
                  owing to the precession of the equinoxes, has ceased to open the astronomical year”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 35). Traditionally, <span class="name">Aries</span> is considered the first sign of the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> because, as <span class="persName">Green</span> explains, it was “the first of the old <span class="name">zodiacal</span> constellations. About four thousand years ago, the vernal equinoctial point entered
                  this sign; but from its apparent motion towards the west, owing to the precession
                  of the equinoxes, it [the vernal equinox] is now found in the sign <span class="name">Pisces</span>, within which it has remained about 2000 years” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 63). In <span class="date">1822</span>, according to <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, the <span class="name">sun</span> then entered <span class="name">Pisces</span> on about <span class="date">6 March</span> and <span class="name">Aries</span> on about <span class="date">22 April</span>. Thus, the vernal equinox, which falls on 20–21 March, occurs when the ecliptic appears
                  oriented toward <span class="name">Pisces</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 50, 35).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> relates the legend associated with the Ram, “which bore the golden fleece. <span class="persName">Nephele</span>, queen of <span class="placeName">Thebes</span>, mother to <span class="persName">Phryxus</span> and <span class="persName">Helle</span>, being apprized of some murderous designs against her children, gave them this ram,
                  on whose back they were to be carried through the air to their friend <span class="persName">Aetes</span>, king of <span class="placeName">Colchis</span>. The rapid motion of the ram during their flight, and their elevation above the <span class="name">earth</span>, made <span class="persName">Helle</span> giddy, and she dropped from the back of the ram into that part of the sea which was
                  afterwards called the <span class="geogName">Hellespont [the Dardanelles]</span>. <span class="persName">Phryxus</span> arrived safe at his destination. Some time after, <span class="persName">Phryxus</span> was murdered at <span class="placeName">Colchis</span> by those who envied him the possession of the golden fleece, and it was this murder
                  which gave rise to the Argonautic expedition for the recovery of the fleece. . . .

               <p>The figure of <span class="name">the Charioteer</span> grasps reins with one hand, although his chariot is not outlined by stars; and with
                  the other hand, he cradles a she‐goat and kids. These incongruous attributes, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> explains, are associated with differing legends.</p> 
               <p>Two legends account for <span class="name">Auriga</span> as a charioteer. In one, he is <span class="persName">Erichthonius</span>, king of <span class="placeName">Athens</span>, who is credited with inventing the chariot. <span class="persName">Green</span> quotes from <span class="persName">Virgil</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Georgics</span></span>: “Primus <span class="persName">Erichthonius</span> currus et quatuor ausus / Jungere equos, rapidisque rotis insistere victor”. As translated
                  by <span class="persName">Dryden</span> in the edition <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> owned: “Bold <span class="persName">Ericthonius</span> was the first who joinʼd / Four horses for the rapid race designʼd” (bk. 3, lines

In gratitude to the goddess, <span class="persName">Erichthonius</span> instituted games known as the Panathenaea (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 50). Perhaps by association with the latter aspect of the legend, “[s]ome suppose
                  <span class="name">Auriga</span> to be the same with <span class="persName">Phaëton</span>, the son of <span class="persName">Sol</span>, who, undertaking to drive the chariot of the sun, set the world on fire, and was

               <p>In other accounts, <span class="name">Boötes</span>, in his role of driving the wagon in <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, is credited with the invention of chariots, whereas <span class="name">Auriga</span> is associated with the story of another chariot racer, <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span>. “Mirtilius, a son of Mercury and Phaetusa, . . . was charioteer to <span class="persName">Oenomaus</span>, king of <span class="placeName">Pisa</span>, in Elis, and so skilled in riding and the management of horses, that he rendered
                  the steeds of his lord the swiftest in <span class="placeName">Greece</span>; but his infidelity to his master proved at last fatal to him” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 21). As <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> goes on to explain, thanks to <span class="persName">Myrtilus</span>ʼs horse training, his king was able to fend off suitors to his beautiful daughter,
                  <span class="persName">Hippodamia</span>, by challenging them to a race in which the penalty was death. After a dozen challengers

               <p><span class="persName">Antinoüs</span>—a historical figure, not a mythical character—“was a great favourite of the <span class="persName">emperor Adrian [i.e., Hadrian]</span>, who erected a temple to his memory, and placed him among the constellations” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 30). In less euphemistic terms, <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> was <span class="persName">Hadrian</span>ʼs lover, whom the emperor deified following the youthʼs death (whether by accident,
                  murder, or ritual suicide) while sailing on the <span class="geogName">Nile</span>, founded a city in his name, and spread his cult worship. Among <span class="persName">Hadrian</span>ʼs many tributes, the re‐naming of an asterism below <span class="name">Aquila (the Eagle)</span> after <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> may have been initiated by the emperor himself. Formerly, that asterism had been
                  figured by Greek astronomers as <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>, the beautiful boy abducted by <span class="persName">Zeus</span> to serve as his cupbearer. <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>, though living when the cult of <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> was still vital, respected the Greek tradition of <span class="persName">Ganymede</span> and <span class="persName">Aquila</span> while compiling the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Almagest</span></span>, but he mentioned the name of <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span>, as a sub‐division of <span class="name">Aquila</span>ʼs stars; he did not count <span class="name">Antinoüs</span> as a constellation separately or combined with <span class="name">Aquila</span> among the forty‐eight in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Almagest</span></span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 50–51).</p> 
               <p>Subsequently, as a constellation in itself, or even as part of the representation
                  of the constellation <span class="name">Aquila</span>, <span class="name">Antinoüs</span> remained unknown to the astronomical lore of the Middle Ages. The name first appeared
                  on star maps in the <span class="date">sixteenth century</span>, the earliest known representation of <span class="name">Antinoüs</span> originating with <span class="persName">Caspar Vopel</span> (<span class="date">1511–61</span>), a cartographer who worked in <span class="placeName">Cologne</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEKKERVOPEL"><span class="persName">Dekker</span>, <span class="titlem">“Caspar Vopelʼs Ventures”</span></a>, 174; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 187; By <span class="date">1822</span>, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> could still characterize the “asterism <span class="name">Antinöus</span> [sic] . . .

               <p><span class="persName">Vopel</span> pictured <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> in his sacrificial act, diving (or falling?) into the <span class="geogName">Nile</span>, a representation that influenced several subsequent <span class="date">sixteenth‐century</span> images, while in some he was shown as a reclining nude on a couch (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEKKERVOPEL"><span class="persName">Dekker</span>, <span class="titlem">“Caspar Vopelʼs Ventures”</span></a>, 174, 176). Soon thereafter, <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> appeared as an independent constellation in a star list by <span class="persName">Tycho Brahe</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 51–52). He was reunited with the Eagle to form a single, dynamic image in the <span class="date">1603</span> <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranometria</span></span> by <span class="persName">Johannes Bayer</span>; however, <span class="persName">Bayer</span> confused or identified <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> with <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>, depicting the youth as borne aloft, naked and surpised, and gripped by his head
                  in the eagleʼs talon, presumably being carried off to be made <span class="persName">Zeus</span>ʼs cupbearer. Unlike <span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs other figures, <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>/<span class="persName">Antinuoüs</span> is not depicted from the back, but straining his right arm and hand into the uncertain
                  space to the left of the onlooker, as if groping for his destination yet fending off
                  his fate with his raised palm (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BAYERURANOMETRIA"><span class="persName">Bayer</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranometria</span></span></a>, pl. 16; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASHWORTHOUTOFTHISWORLD"><span class="persName">Ashworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Out of This World</span></span></a>, 9a).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs pose for <span class="persName">Antinuoüs</span> is taken over by <span class="persName">Johann Bode</span> in his <span class="date">1801</span> <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span>, but <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs figure loses the tension of struggle, leaving him the appearance of kneeling in
                  mid‐air, his arm raised in salute. While the bend of the arm is governed by an exacting
                  arc of stars, <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs figure seems comparatively passive, the features and body serene, as the Eagle
                  merely pushes him along with his claw, without gripping (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BODEURANOGRAPHIA"><span class="persName">Bode</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span></a>, pl. 9). <span class="persName">Johannes Hevelius</span>, in his <span class="date">1687</span> star atlas, likewise united the bird and human as a joint image. Rotating <span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs figures, <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> drives them from left to right, imagining them both as creatures of prey. This <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>/<span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> is not passively carried by the Eagle, but soaring with and even in front of the
                  bird. He is now a cherubic archer, keenly drawing his arrow in the same direction
                  as their flight. Elements of these two depictions—the passive, victimized <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>, and the aggressive <span class="persName">Cupid</span>‐like <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span>—combine in <span class="date">early nineteenth‐century</span> British representations of <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> and <span class="persName">Aquila</span>.</p> 
               <p>In the <span class="date">1820s</span>, of course all the <span class="persName">Antinoüses</span> were decently clothed, a concern with decorum that possibly underlies <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs indignation over “some writers assert[ing] that the figure which accompanies the
                  <span class="name">Eagle</span> is not <span class="persName">Antinous</span>, but <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>; thus referring the whole to one of the exploits of <span class="persName">Jupiter</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 57). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> was not so prudish about identifying the Eagle “as that whose form <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> assumed when he carried to <span class="geogName">mount Ida</span> the beautiful <span class="persName">Ganymede</span>”, (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 30).</p> 
               <p>Decorum aside, as the inheritance of the iconographic traditions became more eclectic,
                  the treatment of the constellation became more disjointed. <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> is a descendant in the line of <span class="persName">Bayer</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs figures, most clearly based on the latter: features impassive; torso erect; both
                  lower legs bent under at the knees, as if kneeling. If both the earlier sets of figures
                  moved as a unit, however, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs pair are pulling apart. The bird is turned 180 degrees, belly up, his wing now
                  adjacent to—not covering—the youthʼs left arm, and the birdʼs talons are fully retracted.
                  While disjoining the figures, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> rumages for attributes, bestowing <span class="persName">Hevelius</span>ʼs archery gear on his <span class="persName">Antinuoüs</span>, finding the stars to trace a bow and arrows in the figureʼs outstetched arm and
                  hand. Yet this <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span> merely holds the weapons, rather than aiming and drawing an arrow in the direction
                  of flight as <span class="persName">Hevelius</span>ʼs figure hunts with the diving bird. The <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span> illustration detaches the boy even further from the eagle by turning <span class="persName">Antinoüs</span>ʼs head to gaze at the viewer, no longer engaged in the direction of his journey.</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, for his part, repeatedly divides conjoined figures from one another. He separates
                  <span class="name">Antinoüs</span> from <span class="name">Aquila</span> and <a class="link_ref" href="#ANSERGLOSS" title="the stupid goose (RF T70 MS III)Of the paired constellation Vulpecula et Anser (Fox and Goose) Ruskin lists here only the victi..."><span class="name">Anser (the Goose)</span></a> from <a class="link_ref" href="#VULPECULAGLOSS" title="the cunning fox (RF T70 MS III)Vulpecula (the Fox) northern constellation.

In the sea,

When <span class="persName">Amphitrite</span> fled <span class="persName">Poseidon</span>ʼs advances, he sent the dolphin as a messenger, who, “with soothing gestures brought

               <p><span class="persName">Green</span> links the constellation to a story about another dolphin, “which saved the life of
                  <span class="persName">Arion</span>, the famous lyric poet and musician of <span class="placeName">Lesbos</span>. . . . <span class="persName">Arion</span>, who had obtained immense riches in <span class="placeName">Italy</span> by his professional skill, resolved to return with his wealth to his native country.
                  The sailors of the ship in which he had embarked, determined to murder him to obtain

                  into the sea. A number of Dolphins had been attracted round the ship by the sweetness
                  of the music, and it is said that one of them supported <span class="persName">Arion</span> on his back, and brought him safe to land. Whatever may have given rise to this story,
                  the ancients agree in representing the <span class="name">Dolphin</span> as the friend and protector of man” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 58–59). This story, <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains, was passed down by <span class="persName">Hyginus</span> and <span class="persName">Ovid</span>, and the responsibility for placing <span class="name">Dolphin</span> among the constellations was ascribed to <span class="persName">Apollo</span>, god of music and poetry. This story also serves as one account of the constellation

               <p><span class="persName">Aspin</span> adds the naturalistic comment that “[p]ainters and sculptors represent the dolphin

               <p>From the time of <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span>, the altar was imagined with its base oriented to the north and with flames rising
                  from its top, oriented to the southern pole, and those visual elements were carried
                  into modern representations (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 47). It seems not just the depiction of flames, however, that moved <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, to insert the epithet <span class="name">“gods fire”</span> into the line as originally drafted in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>; rather, his phrase suggests that he was forestalling association with the pagan
                  rites involved in the myths originally connected with the <span class="name">Altar</span>. The phrase “godʼs fire” imposes a <span class="orgName">Christian</span> typology on the altar flames, referring, e.g., to <span class="titlem">Leviticus</span> 6:12–13: “And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it, it shall not be put
                  out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall burn thereon
                  the fat of the peace‐offerings. The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: it
                  shall never go out”. In a commentary on the passage in his popular annotated <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, <span class="persName">Thomas Scott</span> (<span class="date">1747–1821</span>) reads the Levitical rites as a type of the permanence of <span class="persName">God</span>ʼs justice and <span class="persName">Christ</span>ʼs redemption: just as “the fire on the altar was kindled from heaven”, <span class="persName">Scott</span> explains, “and it must not be suffered to go out” causing it to “be replaced by ordinary
                  fire”, so “this fire was an intended type of the eternal avenging justice of <span class="persName">God</span>, and the perpetual efficacy of <span class="persName">Christ</span>ʼs all‐sufficient atonement” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Holy Bible . . . with Explanatory Notes, Practical Observations, and Copious Marginal

               <p>As an example of how the <span class="titlem">Leviticus</span> verse was applied as a historical type from <span class="titlem">Old Testament</span> to <span class="titlem">New</span> in Evangelical discourse, a writer for the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evangelical Magazine</span></span> cites “the watchfulness of the [Levite] ministers of the sanctuary—to preserve the
                  sacred fire on the altar. As this was kindled from heaven, and it was unlawful to
                  offer strange fire; the Levites watched to preserve the sacred flame from extinction,
                  by supplying it with fuel night and day. In this way <span class="persName">God</span> taught his ancient people the duty of watchfulness and incessant prayer, by rites
                  and ceremonies, which accorded with the genius of that dispensation when the church
                  was under age. But now that it is come to its majority, our <span class="persName">Lord</span> instructs us in a more manly way, by addresses to our judgment, conscience, and hearts,
                  which should lead us to . . . Watchfulness and Prayer” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MEDITATIONSEVANGELICALMAG1835-12"><span class="titlem">“Meditations on Mark XIII.33”</span></a>, 489).</p> 
               <p>Whether <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> and <span class="persName">Green</span> remained strategically silent about the stories surrounding <span class="name">Ara</span>, fearing to meddle with pagan rites, or they considered the small constellation too
                  minor and too far south for English observers to merit a lengthy description, for
                  ancient writers this altar in the sky ranked as “a special one”, according to <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>. As described by both the Greek writer, <span class="persName">Eratosthenes</span>, and the Roman writer, <span class="persName">Manilius</span>, this altar was “used by the gods themselves to swear a vow of allegiance before
                  their fight against the <span class="persName">Titans</span>”. According to legend, <span class="persName">Cronus</span>—the chief of the most ancient gods, the giant <span class="persName">Titans</span>—swallowed all his children in an attempt to thwart a prophesy that they would grow
                  up to overthrow him. To prevent this fate befalling the latest child, <span class="persName">Zeus</span>, <span class="persName">Cronus</span>ʼs wife, <span class="persName">Rhea</span>, sent the infant to <span class="placeName">Crete</span> to be hidden in a cave. Meanwhile, she deceived <span class="persName">Cronus</span> by giving him a rock to swallow in place of the infant god. When <span class="persName">Zeus</span> had grown to maturity, he returned from <span class="placeName">Crete</span> and forced his father to vomit his siblings—<span class="persName">Hestia</span>, <span class="persName">Demeter</span>, <span class="persName">Hera</span>, <span class="persName">Hades</span>, and <span class="persName">Poseidon</span>—who were now also fully grown. Together, the new generation of gods vowed on the
                  altar, <span class="name">Ara</span>, to battle against <span class="persName">Cronus</span> and the <span class="persName">Titans</span> until defeating and overtaking the rule by the ancient gods (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 46–47; and see <a class="link_ref" href="AQUILAGLOSS"><span class="name">Aquila [the Eagle]</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="AURIGAGLOSS"><span class="name">Auriga [the Charioteer]</span></a>).</p>

His lessons in physics
                  derived from <span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span> and <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>, in which air pumps figure prominently as an experimental and instructional devices
                  for young investigators (see <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span></a>).</p> 
               <p>In <span class="persName">Lacaille</span>ʼs initial represetation of the constellation, which he named <span class="name">Machine Pneumatique</span>, he outlined the early single‐cylinder type of air pump used by physicists in the
                  <span class="date">seventeenth century</span>. By the time of its representation in <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Uranographia</span></span> (<span class="date">1801</span>), the representation of <span class="name">Antlia</span> was modernized to the double‐cylinder type of pump, which eighteenth‐century physicists
                  used to create a vacumn (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 39–40). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs drawing is not <span class="persName">Bode</span>ʼs but appears to update <span class="persName">Lacaille</span>ʼs triangular‐shaped device by adding a double‐cylinder apparatus. <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> has little to say about <span class="persName">Lacaille</span>ʼs “novel asterism . . . formed out of a few stars between <span class="name">Hydra</span> and <span class="name">Argo Navis</span>”, and that little is merely plagiarized by <span class="persName">Green</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 61 and pl.26; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 103).</p> 
               <p>Given <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs familiarity with the air pump through his reading, it is puzzling that he substituted
                  a constellation associated with geometry, a subject which he is not known to have
                  studied during this period. <span class="name">“Euclidʼs Square”</span> is a translation of the Latin name Quadra Euclidis, which in turn is an alternate
                  name for the constellation, <span class="name">Norma et Regula (Square and Rule)</span>. According to <span class="persName">Green</span> in <span class="date">1824</span>, this “modern group” of objects in the sky was “sometimes . . . called <span class="name">Euclidʼs Square</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 86).</p> 
               <p>This southern constellation, which lies between <span class="name">Ara (the Altar)</span> and <span class="name">Lupus (the Wolf)</span>, was another invention by <span class="persName">Lacaille</span>, who called it lʼEquerre et la Regle on his star map of <span class="date">1756</span>, referring to a draughtsmanʼs set‐square and ruler, a name that soon became Latinized
                  as <span class="name">Norma et Regula</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 127).

               <p><span class="name">Leo Minor</span> was created in <span class="date">1687</span> by the Polish astronomer <span class="persName">Hevelius</span> from stars between <span class="name">Ursa Major</span> and <span class="name">Leo</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 114).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Leo Minor</span> appears to have no legends associated with it—<span class="persName">Jamieson</span> debunks a claim that the constellation “owns its place in the heavens to the fable
                  of <span class="persName">Hercules</span> killing the Nemæan lion” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 23). As if in compensation, stories are implied by the figures in the <span class="date">nineteenth‐century</span> star maps, in which <span class="name">Leo Minor</span>ʼs association with different bordering constellations is highlighted in each atlas.
                  These varying choices were probably dictated primarily by the writerʼs instructions
                  for locating the constellation in the sky, relative to other constellations. Since
                  <span class="persName">Green</span> instructs the reader to find <span class="name">Leo Minor</span> “immediately to the southward of the hind paws of <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>”, his “second plate” features those two animals (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 30, pl. 2). At the same time, the differing pairings of highlighted creatures inevitably
                  suggest competing narratives. <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">plate 5</span> highlights the adjacency of <span class="name">Leo Minor</span> with <span class="name">Lynx</span> probably because both constellations were created by <span class="persName">Hevelius</span>, as remarked in the text; however, the picture also seems to put the lion in pursuit
                  of the lynx (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 23, pl. 5). In contrast, <span class="titlem">Card 20</span> of <span class="name">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span>, <span class="titlem">“Leo Major and Leo Minor”</span>, while modeling its figures on <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs, suggests a milder story than his by highlighing the pairing of <span class="name">Leo Minor</span> with <span class="name">Leo</span>, as if the little one is the cub of the larger.</p>

When he set out to vanquish the Gorgons”—sisters “who had the power

                  glass; and he received from <span class="persName">Mercury</span> wings and a dagger, or sword”. Equipped with these armaments, which are represented
                  in <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs drawing of the hero, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> “cut off the head of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>, and from the blood which dropped from it in its passage through the air” as he flew
                  on <span class="persName">Mercury</span>ʼs wings, there “sprang an innumerable quantity of serpents, which ever after infested

                  of his myth, in which he is prophesied to kill his grandfather and eventually does
                  so. He is the enemy of tyrants, however, and the constant protector of his mother
                  and stepfather (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 140–42).</p> 
               <p>Versions of the myth differ in classical sources, which are variously retold in the
                  star atlases. In the version told by <span class="persName">Hyginus</span> in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fabulae</span></span>, <span class="persName">Andromeda</span> is already promised as a bride before <span class="persName">Perseus</span> rescues her. In <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs telling of this version, “[a]fter being promised in marriage by her father [<span class="persName">Cepheus</span>] to her uncle, <span class="persName">Phineus</span>, [<span class="persName">Andromeda</span>] gave herself up to be devoured by a sea monster”. Following her rescue, “<span class="persName">Cepheus</span>, her father, then betrothed her to <span class="persName">Perseus</span>. This contemplated union was violently opposed by <span class="persName">Phineus</span>, who, after a furious battle with his rival, was converted into a stone by the wonder
                  working head of the <span class="persName">Gorgon</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 40). In <span class="persName">Ovid</span>ʼs version, which may have been a source for <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs telling, there is no betrothal previous to <span class="persName">Perseus</span>ʼs; rather, <span class="persName">Perseus</span>, so amazed by <span class="persName">Andromeda</span>ʼs beauty that he at first mistakes the chained figure for a marble statue, calls
                  on <span class="persName">Cepheus</span> and <span class="persName">Cassiopeia</span> to accept him as a son‐in‐law before he saves the maiden. Their consent readily granted,
                  <span class="persName">Perseus</span> accepts the modest and compliant <span class="persName">Andromeda</span> without asking a dower and returns home. <span class="persName">Ovid</span>ʼs version is not <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs source for battle with <span class="name">Cetus</span>, however. In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Metamorphoses</span></span>, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> slays <span class="name">Cetus</span> with the sword bestowed by the gods rather than turning it to stone with <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs head. Instead, <span class="persName">Perseus</span> lays the head aside on a bed of seaweed, which soaks up the venom and hardens, accounting

               <p><span class="persName">Aspin</span> adds here: “The Jewish Rabbins have a legend of <span class="persName">Nimrod</span>, very similar to this of <span class="persName">Bellerophon</span>, which authorizes us to place this constellation among the oldest in the sphere”

The association between the two legends (which is not mentioned in <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs primary source, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span>) is “authorized” typologically rather than historically, except on the grounds of
                  biblical chronology—the “events” surrounding <span class="persName">Nimrod</span> having occurred “a hundred and one years after the deluge” according to “[m]any learned
                  men”, and therefore prior to Egyptian, Mesopotamian, or Greek mythologies (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="persName">Thomas Scott</span>, commentary on <span class="titlem">Gen. 11</span>, <span class="titlem">Holy Bible</span>, ed. <span class="persName">Scott</span></a>, 1:64). <span class="persName">Aspin</span> bases the similarity between <span class="persName">Nimrod</span> and <span class="persName">Bellerophon</span> apparently on the story of the <span class="placeName">Tower of Babel</span>, which was erected with the ambition that its “top may reach unto heaven” (<span class="titlem">Gen. 11:4</span>). Similarly, <span class="persName">Aspin</span> reads the constellation <a class="link_ref" href="#ORIONGLOSS" title="belt of orion (RF T70 MS III)Orion (the Hunter) southern constellation situated on the equator and bounded (as reckoned in the ..."><span class="name">Orion</span></a> as typologically related to <span class="persName">Nimrod</span> in the heroesʼ analogous pride and boasting. In that case, <span class="persName">Aspin</span> links the two figures by their shared identities as great hunters, which is at least
                  borne out by texts of their legends. In the case of the <span class="placeName">Babel</span> story, <span class="persName">Nimrod</span>ʼs character shifts to the “first king”, a conqueror and oppressor, and a builder
                  of cities—“the principal person concerned in building both <span class="placeName">Babylon</span> and <span class="placeName">Nineveh</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTBIBLE"><span class="persName">Scott</span>, commentary on <span class="titlem">Gen. 10</span>, <span class="titlem">Holy Bible</span>, ed. <span class="persName">Scott</span></a>, 1:62).

A clarification is supplied by <span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, who explains that, while “she is also known as <span class="persName">Astraeia</span>, daughter of <span class="persName">Astraeus</span> (father of the stars) and <span class="persName">Eos</span> (goddess of the dawn)”, <span class="name">Virgo</span>ʼs association with justice connects her primarily with “<span class="persName">Dike</span>, . . . the daughter of <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and <span class="persName">Themis</span>. . . . <span class="persName">Dike</span> was supposed to have lived on Earth in the Golden Age of mankind, when <span class="persName">Cronus</span> ruled <span class="placeName">Olympus</span>. It was a time of peace and happiness, a season of perennial spring when food grew
                  without cultivation and humans never grew old. Men lived like the gods, not knowing
                  work, sorrow, crime, or war. <span class="persName">Dike</span> moved among them, dispensing wisdom and justice”. The change from the Golden Age
                  to the Silver Age was initiated by the overthrow of <span class="persName">Cronus</span> and the <span class="persName">Titans</span> by <span class="persName">Zeus</span> and his siblings, who introduced the seasons and consequently cycles of scarcity
                  and conflict. <span class="persName">Dike</span> flew to the mountains; and when the Silver Age declined into the Bronze Age, she
                  flew to the heavens, taking her place next to <span class="name">Libra</span>; and because of <span class="persName">Dike</span>ʼs abandonment of mankind, <span class="name">Virgo</span> is represented with wings (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 179–80). </p>  
               <p>For <span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="name">Virgo</span>ʼs association with the autumn equinox touches off controversy over calculating the
                  age of the world. Just as, in discussing <a class="link_ref" href="#LEOGLOSS" title="the generous leo (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Leo (the Lion) constellation of the northern Zodiac the fifth in the order of the Zodiac ..."><span class="name">Leo</span></a>, <span class="persName">Green</span> rails against “antiquaries” who date ancient artifacts containing <span class="name">Zodiacal</span> signs based on the precession of the equinoxes, and thus arrive at conclusions that
                  conflict with the numbering of generations listed in the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, here his indignation rises against the “modern philosopher” whose “speculations”
                  lead to impiety: “We have mentioned that the sign <span class="name">Leo</span> commences the <span class="name">zodiac</span> of <span class="placeName">Dendera</span>; but another zodiac has been discovered in <span class="placeName">Egypt</span> at <span class="placeName">Estné</span>, carved on a portico among the ruins at that place, commencing with the sign <span class="name">Virgo</span>; and from this circumstance it has been argued, that it must be at least two thousand
                  years older than the one at <span class="placeName">Dendera</span>. Some late discoveries respecting Egyptian writing, made by <span class="persName">M. Champollion</span>, have rendered it more than probable, that this ancient relic of astrology at <span class="placeName">Estné</span> was erected during the reign of the emperor <span class="persName">Claudius</span>, and that it could have preceded the one at <span class="placeName">Dendera</span> at most but by the duration of his reign, which continued only fourteen years. .
                  . . We should have passed this subject without notice, if the spirit of modern inquiry
                  did not strangely connect the speculations of science, and even those of fancy, with
                  the truths of revealed religion. The modern philosopher rejects as fabulous the chronology
                  of the <span class="titlem">Bible</span>, established on the uninterrupted evidence of a series of generations, and, by a
                  wonderful inconsistency and credulity, places implicit faith in the uncertain interpretation
                  of Egyptian signs and hieroglyphics, the date and the meaning of which are unknown”
                  (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 80). <span class="persName">Green</span>ʼs objections, by exposing the supposed unscientific procedures of his adversaries,
                  reflect the influence of <span class="persName">Thomas Chalmers</span>ʼs approach to the “evidences” of <span class="orgName">Christianity</span> in relation to science (on the <span class="titlem">Zodiac of Dendera</span>, see also <a class="link_ref" href="#LIBRAGLOSS" title="the scales (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Libra (the Balance) southern constellation the first of the southern Zodiac signs and the seven..."><span class="name">Libra</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="#LEOGLOSS" title="the generous leo (MS IA RF T70 MS III)Leo (the Lion) constellation of the northern Zodiac the fifth in the order of the Zodiac ...">Leo</a>).</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, for his part, appears to find no grounds for contradiction. If <span class="name">Virgo</span> once coincided with the vernal rather than autumnal equinox, “that <span class="name">zodiac</span> carries us back 90° on the Ecliptic, and its date must be fixed about 6450 years
                  ago. This deduction, according to the chronology of the Sacred Writings, carries us
                  back to the earliest ages of the human species on earth, and proves, at least, that
                  Astronomy was among the first studies of mankind. The most rational way of accounting
                  for this <span class="name">zodiac</span> seems to be, by assigning it to the family of <span class="persName">Noah</span>, or perhaps to the patriarch himself; in which case it may be considered as a monument
                  that perpetuates the actual state of the heavens immediately subsequent to the creation.
                  In short, if it be fact, as appears, that <span class="persName">Noah</span> himself travelled eastward after the deluge, and his whole life leads us to believe
                  he was versed in all the science of his time, he might also transmit to his posterity,
                  the zodiac of the antedeluvians, without the equator or ecliptic. But though <span class="geogName">Asia</span> might thus become the cradle of Astronomy, the stargazers of ancient <span class="placeName">Egypt</span> in process of time were, without doubt, instructed in the true system of the world;
                  and attributed the order which reigns in nature to the wisdom of a supreme and eternal
                  First Cause, though they publicly chimed in with the popular errors of the multitude”

                  the unicorn, as in <span class="titlem">Psalm</span> 92 (<span class="titlem">KJV</span>), in which the unicorn is associated with strength. According to bestiaries, a unicorn
                  could be captured only by a virgin; and therefore, In Christian iconography, the beast
                  came to symbolize chastity and to figure as a type of <span class="persName">Christ</span>, particularly associated with the Incarnation and the Virgin birth (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#UNICORNOCCAA"><span class="titlem">“Unicorn”</span>, in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Murray</span> and <span class="persName">Murray</span></a>, 551).</p>

               <p>Traditionally, the sun is said to enter <span class="name">Libra</span> on September 23, on the day of the autumn equinox. By modern dating, accounting for
                  precession, the <span class="name">sun</span> enters the sign on October 27, according to <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs reckoning in the <span class="date">1820s</span>. At the time of the autunm equinox, “we are accustomed to say that when the <span class="name">Sun</span> comes to <span class="name">Libra</span>, . . . the days and nights are then equal all over the earth”, appropriately to the
                  sign of the balance, “except at the poles; and that it is the beginning of day at
                  the South Pole, and the end of day at the North Pole” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 44).</p> 
               <p><span class="name">Libra</span> bore differing meaning and significance for the Greeks and for the Romans—a difference
                  reflected in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first‐drafted and first fair‐copied lines versus his subsequently revised lines
                  on the constellation (see textual note). His initial idea, playing on a name for <span class="name">Libra</span> as “the scales” rather than “the balance”, relates to the Greek notion that the constellation
                  “perpetuate[d] the memory of <span class="persName">Mochus</span>, the inventor of weights and measures” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 44). In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs figure, because the scales are aerial, they “nothing to weigh would bear”, and
                  “yet contain a thousand more” (stars, presumably), perhaps even “more than than the
                  milky way” contains.</p> 
               <p>In his revision, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substitutes the Roman interpretation of the scales as a balance of justice, “in which
                  twas vainly said / The crimes and virtues of men were weighed”—“vainly”, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> presumably means, because pagan justice has been superceded by <span class="orgName">Christian</span> judgment. <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> explains why the representation of balanced justice made <span class="name">Libra</span> a “favoured constellation” for the Romans: “The <span class="name">Moon</span> was said to have been in <span class="name">Libra</span> when <span class="placeName">Rome</span> was founded”. Thus, according to the Roman writer <span class="persName">Manilius</span> in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomica</span></span>, “What sign would better have the care of Italy . . . than that which controls all,
                  knows the weights of things, marks totals, and separates the unequal from the equal,
                  the sign in which the seasons are balanced and the hours of night and day match each
                  other?” For it is given to <span class="placeName">Italy</span> in turn to control all. <span class="placeName">Italy</span> “belongs to the Balance, her rightful sign: beneath it <span class="placeName">Rome</span> and her sovereignty of the world were founded. <span class="placeName">Rome</span>, which controls the issue of events, exalting and depressing nations placed in the
                  scales: beneath this sign was born the emperor, who has now effected a better foundation
                  of the city and governs a world which hangs on his command alone” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 116–17; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MANILIUSASTRONOMICA"><span class="persName">Manilius</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomica</span></span></a>, 283, 285 [bk. 4, lines 769–77]).</p>

                  signs” of the <span class="name">Zodiac</span>, “<span class="name">Sagittarius</span> is actually in possession of the first Winter sign, for the <span class="name">Sun</span> enters it about the 7th of December” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="persName">Jamieson</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 46).</p> 
               <p>“According to Grecian fable”, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> claims, <span class="name">Sagittarius</span> “is <span class="persName">Chiron</span>, one of the centaurs, and son of <span class="persName">Saturn</span> and <span class="persName">Philyra</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 46). <span class="persName">Aspin</span> elaborates: <span class="persName">Chiron</span> “was famous for his skill in medicine, music, and archery, and instructed in the
                  polite arts the greatest heroes of his time. Being accidentally wounded with a poisonous
                  arrow by <span class="persName">Hercules</span>, and the wound, which was incurable, causing him great anguish, <span class="persName">Chiron</span> prayed <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> to deprive him of immortality, that he might, by dying, be relieved from his excruciating
                  pains. <span class="persName">Jupiter</span> assented to his request, and changed him into the constellation <span class="name">Sagittarius</span>” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 139). <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> represents <span class="name">Sagittarius</span> as a centaur in <span class="titlem">plate 20</span>, drawing his bow and arrow, aimed seemingly at <span class="name">Scorpio</span>ʼs tail.</p> 
               <p><span class="persName">Ridpath</span>, however, remarks the uncertainty among the Greek mythographers, who inherited the
                  figure of a hunter from Sumerian astrology but not necessarily that of a centaur.
                  Decidedly, <span class="persName">Ridpath</span> argues, the Archer is “misidentified as <span class="persName">Chiron</span>”, for “<span class="persName">Chiron</span> is in fact represented by the other celestial centaur, the constellation <span class="name">Centaurus</span>”. While <span class="persName">Aratus</span> and <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span> described <span class="name">Sagittarius</span> as a centaur, the Greek poet <span class="persName">Eratosthenes</span> and the Roman poet <span class="persName">Hyginus</span> believed him to be a two‐legged satyr, named <span class="persName">Crotus</span>—a confusion that is remarked by <span class="persName">Green</span>. <span class="persName">Crotus</span> is said to have invented archery and lived among the Muses on <span class="geogName">Mount Helicon</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Star Tales</span></span></a>, 154; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GREENASTRONOMICALRECREATIONS"><span class="persName">Green</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Astronomical Recreations</span></span></a>, 85).</p>

               <p>Ruskinʼs line bestows a poetic epithet on the sky rather than on the constellation,
                  which in his description suggests nothing more than a barnyard goat. <span class="name">Capricornus</span>, however, is a strange composite creature of goat and fish, a phenomenon that involves

                  which he calls “lame”. As if to draw attention away from the stories, <span class="persName">Jamieson</span> seems reluctant in his plate to exhibit the strangeness of the creature, highlighting
                  realistically the goat that forms the upper half of the body, while only outlining
                  the fishtail that forms its lower half—the latter space dominated by the drawing of
                  <span class="name">Capricornusʼs</span> near neighbor, <span class="name">Aquarius</span> (plate 21) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, 46–47).

               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have averted to the immaterial “arched sky”, shying away from the Greek legends
