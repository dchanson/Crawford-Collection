The leaf 31r&#x2013;v has been attached to 30v with tape, and a stub along the inside margin of 31v shows that a leaf has been torn out. Following 31v, the gathering 32r&#x2013;37v is loose and could be missing outermost leaves.
                       The inside front board is blank except for <orgName corresp="#YALE">Yale&#x02bc;s </orgName> bookplate and, unlike the other <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#REDBOOK"></title>Red Books</ref> in the slipcase <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry &#x0026; Lucy</title>, does not have glued or tipped in a brief description of the notebook penned by <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>(?) with a clipping from PJR. <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title> was never described by the earlier editors, however, neither in PJR nor in Works. <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>, or whoever was responsible for slipcasing the juvenilia, was evidently content to include <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title> in the <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</title> slipcase, where it logically belonged.
                       Title page (1r):  <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">HARRY AND LUCY</title> / CONCLUDED / BEING / THE LAST PART / OF / EARLY LESSONS / BY / <persName corresp="#JR">JOHN RUSKIN</persName>/ IN FOUR VOLUMES / VOL III / HERNHILL / DULWICH.  On back of the title page (1v), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imitated a printed page of  ERRATA. 
                       Unlike the  <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</title>  narratives in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">III</title>, this volume of the tale is written entirely in ink; however, this volume contains no  plates,  for which pencil had been reserved in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, even when the text was ink. Later in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title>, the mineralogy notes and sermon draft are written in pencil.
                       The pages following  <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</title>  that are blank except for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin's</persName> page numbering (pp. 10&#x2013;29) must have been intended for the continuation of the narrative, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> prepared the pages in the same way as pp. 1&#x2013;9&#x2014;i.e., with verticle rules in pencil near the inside and outside margins, serving as guides to  justify <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02bc;s</persName> printing.
                        <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> misdated <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIIIA">MS IIIA</title> as autumn <date when="1828">1828</date>, <date when="182930">1829-30</date>, <date when="1832">1832</date>. The mineralogy notes, no. 172, are presumably no earlier than the note on payment for the <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName> and for  mineralogy articles,  which precedes the notes written from the end of the volume. Payment for <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName> must refer to translating the <title type="poem" corresp="Iliad">Iliad</title> (no. 160a) in <date when="1832-02-27">late February 1832</date>:  But <persName corresp="#HOMER">Homer</persName>! I am happy to inform you, sir, that I have translated about 550 lines of the first book. . . . These however I do suppose are news to you extremely unwelcome&#x2014;unwelcome owing to what <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> will have to pay (<ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1832-02-27">letter of <date when="1832-02-27">27 February 1832</date></title></ref> [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><persName corresp="#VAB">Burd</persName>, ed., <title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref> 268&#x2013;69]). The following mineralogy notes were entered considerably later, I believe, probably after December <date when="1832">1832</date> (see note to no. 172). Finally, following the mineralogical notes, the rough draft of the eighteenth <title type="sermon" corresp="#JRSERMONSONTHEPENTATEUCH">Sermon on the Pentateuch</title> could have been entered anytime in <date when="1833">1833</date> after sermons <title type="manuscript" corresp="VIII-X">VIII-X</title> were drafted early in that year (see nos. 174-75).</p>

                    <p>Forward from front of book:
                        a) Following title page (1r), a list of  errata  (1v).
                        b) Vol. 3 of  <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</title>,  no. 32 (pp. 1&#x2013;9 [2r&#x2013;6r]). The end of the narrative (pp. 7&#x2013;9 [5r&#x2013;6r]), is nearly identical to its draft in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title>. The fair&#x2010;copy text is broken off in the middle of a sentence.
                        c) Blank pp. 10&#x2013;11 (6v&#x2013;7r), presumably left open for continuation of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</title>, never completed.
                        d) Mineralogy notes, no. 172 (pp. 12&#x2013;15 [7v&#x2013;9r]), later composed on pp. originally set aside for continuation of  <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">Harry and Lucy</title>. These notes appear roughly contemporaneous with j below.
                        e) Blank, 9v&#x2013;24v (9v&#x2013;15r numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> pp. 16&#x2013;29, and 15v&#x2013;23v left completely blank).
                        f) List of minerals keyed to numbers of unknown significance (24r).
                        g) Blank, 24v&#x2013;25r.
                        Forward from back of book:
                        h) Mineral list, no. 186 (38r).
                        i) List of payments to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> by <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> (37v):
                        s.	d

                        _______
                        Paid	1.	6 <!-- Removed tags around the 1 and the 6 on this line because I could not figure out why they are invalid.-->
                        Presumably, the total paid is crossed out, because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had short-changed himself a shilling. According to no. 148, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was getting a halfpenny per line for his  greek  in late <date when="1831">1831</date> and early <date when="1832">1832</date>, presumably for his translation of the <title type="poem" corresp="Iliad">Iliad</title> (see no. 160a). It is not clear what  lines  he is counting, but 24 lines to earn a shilling for a  page  appears a likely equation.
                            From this sum, we also discover that a mineralogical  article  earned a penny, and, at least at this time, poetry composition was paid a farthing per five lines of poetry (see no. 91).
                            j) Mineralology notes (36v, 35v, 34v), no. 172. These notes alternate with blank pages (37r, 36r, 35r, 34r; 37r contains a few words).
                            k) Draft of sermon 18, no. 182 (32v, 31v, 30v, 29v, 28v, 27v, 26v, 25v). As in j, the draft pages alternate with blank pages (32r, 30r, 29r, 28r, 27r, 26r).
                            l) Pen and ink sketch of group of trees on an outcropping of rock (31r, undatable).
