                    <p>A 12 × 18.5 cm, pre&#x2010;ruled notebook, covered with greenish marbled boards, half&#x2010;bound in chocolate calf, and gilt (the same binding as that described by <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> [Poems (4o, <date when="1891">1891</date>), 1:263; Poems (8o, <date when="1891">1891</date>), 1:264]). The leaves measure 11 × 17.7 cm.
                    Collation
                    Following and not including the marbled front endpaper: three blank leaves + 167 pp. as numbered by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> (with p. 1 starting on a recto, and with p. 37 given twice) + 3 blank leaves + back marbled endpaper.
                    The three leaves at the beginning and end of the notebook are unruled and, unlike the ruled leaves that make up the main part of the notebook, bear the watermark &#x201c;Smith &#x0026; A[(?)] / 18[(?)]&#x201d;. This difference in papers might suggest a rebinding of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, but the worn marbled boards appear original, as do the leather corners. Also, the edges of the paper were marbled in a color that may once have matched the boards. It seems likely, therefore, that <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> has come down to us in the same binding in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> first used it.
                    <title type="manuscript" corresp="#BATTLEOFWATERLOOMS">Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems</title>
                    A handmade pamphlet with this title, its pages disassembled, is tipped in at the back of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>. Originally, the pamphlet formed no part of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, and it must not have been inserted when <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> described <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, as he does not mention it. (See <title type="drama" corresp="#JRBATTLEOFWATERLOOPLAY">&#x201c;Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts&#x201d;</title> for the likelihood that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> was unaware of this pamphlet at all when compiling Poems [<date when="1891">1891</date>].)
                        The pamphlet was probably inserted by <persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName>, and no later than <date when="1903">1903</date>, since <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood's</persName> <title type="bibliography_text" corresp="#COLLINGWOODPRELIMINARYNOTE">&#x201c;Notes on the Original MSS. of Poems&#x201d;</title>, as elaborated in the Library Edition, adds to the description of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>: &#x201c;In this book . . . are now inserted the leaves of a thin paper book&#x201d; containing <title type="drama" corresp="#JRBATTLEOFWATERLOOPLAY">&#x201c;Battle of Waterloo: A Play in Two Acts&#x201d;</title> and other works (<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:531). The addition is mentioned also on a leaf tipped in between the marbled front endpapers of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>; like similar leaves in some of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#REDBOOK"></title>Red Books</ref>, these hold a clipping from Poems (<date when="1891">1891</date>) describing <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, along with brief remarks penned probably by <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName>. It is perplexing why this pamphlet was not included in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, a collection compiled after <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02bc;s</persName> editing of Poems (<date when="1891">1891</date>), just as it is perplexing, and intriguing, why the contents of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> were omitted from <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSXI">MS XI</title>.
                    The pamphlet requires a description of its own:
                    Most of the booklet’s leaves have been cut at the fold and tipped separately onto successive pages of the notebook. If nothing is lacking&#x2014;and only a front portion of cover, made of heavier paper, has likely disappeared&#x2014;the booklet consists of 8 leaves that were folded once to form 16 pp., 10 x 16 cm. The innermost fold, leaves 4&#x2013;5, remains intact, tending to confirm how the booklet was constructed. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> numbered the pages 1&#x2013;14, starting with 2r.
                        In addition to this gathering, a back cover remains that is white on the inside, facing p. 16, and bright pink on the outer side, and that looks to be the same age as the other leaves. No matching front cover is extant. Nothing is written on the back cover, but it presumably formed part of the pamphlet when the editors discovered the little anthology; otherwise, they would have had no reason to include it. There is no assurance, however, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself was responsible for the pink cover, when he constructed the pamphlet in <date when="1829">1829</date>, and there is no way of knowing what, if anything, might have been written or drawn on the front cover.</p>

                    Beneath <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin's</persName> main title for the anthology, <title type="anthology" corresp="#MISCELLANEOUSPOETRY">“Miscellaneous Poetry,”</title> and above the title of the first poem, <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> wrote,  “By <persName corresp="#JR">J. Ruskin</persName> from 10 years to 11 to 12 to of age,” with a long space left perhaps to allow for adding <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin's</persName> ages as the years went by. As it turned out, the fair-copied poems in the notebook did not extend quite far enough into <date when="1832">1832</date> to justify <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> entering age “13” into the space.
                    <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G.

The dates are probably those of production, for they are slightly inconsecutive; which would not be the case if they were dates of entry; and, when chronologically arranged, they tally with the order of the first drafts in No. VI” (Poems [4o, <date when="1891">1891</date>], 1:263; Poems [8o, <date when="1891">1891</date>], 1:264). See Discussion for speculation about why the anthology was not carried beyond <date when="1832">1832</date>.

                    <p><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> is the earliest major manuscript that was originally neither a <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#REDBOOK"></title>Red Book</ref> nor a homemade booklet. Another new development that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> starts with <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> is the practice of keeping one notebook for carefully copied presentation of his poetry, while drafting his poems in other notebooks—<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVI">MS VI</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVIII">MS VIII</title>, especially. Some evidence suggests that he took both sorts of notebooks along with him on journeys (see “The Day of Judgement”), entering the fair copies in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> on Sundays or other days when the family paused from traveling. Just so, the Diary of <date when="1830">1830</date> was “written up” from notes during a lengthened stop.
                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did compile poetry anthologies prior to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, but they were comparatively brief and served to fill out <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#REDBOOK"></title>Red Books</ref> whose main feature was the ongoing <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">"Harry and Lucy"</title> narrative: see <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title> Poetry Anthology, Poetry Descriptive, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> Second Poetry Anthology, and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> Poetry Anthology.
                    While no apparent logic governs completion of the anthology other than filling the notebook, it appears from <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin's</persName> open-ended record of his son’s age as the boy entered successive fair copies (see Description) that the father at least may have looked for completion on those terms. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, however, left over thirty pages blank at the end of the manuscript (see Contents); and the likeliest explanation for this neglect may be that he was drawn to a grander project—the fair copy in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title> of “Iteriad” and “Athens.” Selections from these epic-length poems appear toward the end of <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title>, suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> grew dissatisfied with their constrained appearance in <title type="anthology" corresp="#MISCELLANEOUSPOETRY">Miscellaneous Poetry</title> and abandoned the anthology for grander presentation in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>. (Since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not complete fair-copying “Athens” in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>, however, it is also possible that he returned to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSV">MS V</title> to enter 17 stanzas of that poem on a less ambitious scale than that begun in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSVII">MS VII</title>.)
                    On p. 167—a verso, facing the first of the three blank final leaves (see Description)—<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote in ink, but then erased,  <title type="anthology" corresp="#MISCELLANEOUSPOETRY">MISCELLANEOUS POETRY</title> / HELVELLYN.  This is how the notebook begins on p. 1, so the reason for the erasure is not apparent. Since the erased material is upside down to the text coming from the other direction, perhaps it represents a false start.
                    On the back inside endpaper, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> scribbled some numbers.</p>
