                    <p>In the bibliography of the Library Edition, section III (&#x201C;Catalogue of Ruskin MSS.&#x201D;), subsection B (&#x201C;Diaries and Note&#x2010;books&#x201D;), 
                        the editors list under &#x201C;Note&#x2010;books&#x201D; a group of manuscripts that they entitle &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:206). 
                        They intend the categorical title &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D; to apply to all the &#x201C;MSS., containing Poems, Geological Notes, etc., etc.,&#x201D; 
                        comprised by their expanded version of <persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> descriptive bibliography, &#x201C;Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems&#x201D;<!-- Link to a note on this "Note" --> 
                        in volume 2 of the Library Edition<!-- Link to a note on this "Lib Ed" --> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 2:529&#x2013;34).
                        The title &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D; came to be applied in particular, however, to &#x201C;three small books&#x201D; that, in the main bibiography in volume 38, 
                        the editors note as an addendum to &#x201C;those [MSS.] there described&#x201D; in <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> &#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D; reprinted and expanded in volume 2 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 38:206), 
                        these three notebooks being nowhere described. (<persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName> omitted these three manuscripts from his original
                        &#x201C;Preliminary Note&#x201D; presumably because they contained no poetry by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>.)</p>
                    <p>As a result, the title &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D; stuck for these three notebooks in particular, as attested 
                        by the embossing of this title on the spine of the blue morocco slipcase containing the three notebooks, a slipcase that was constructed at perhaps the same time that the bibliography volume 
                        of the Library Edition was being compiled 
                        (see below, Location, Provenance). Consequently, the three notebooks came to be listed for sale under the title &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D; in 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.html#SOTHEBYCAT1930">Sotheby &#x0026; Co., <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Manuscripts and Remaining Library of John Ruskin</hi></ref>,

                    <p>I have conventionalized the title &#x201C;MS Juvenilia C&#x201D; as referring to the third of the three notebooks, identified by the editors as (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>) in their list of &#x201C;Juvenilia&#x201D;

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> evidently planned this <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.html">Red Book</ref> initially to serve as a travel diary for the famiy journey of <date when="1828">1828</date>.

                            and the father following up and elaborating the list. The planned itinerary takes up 15 2&#x2010;page<!--TPD: Should this be "two-page?"  There is also another instance of 2-page in the file--> spreads (1v&#x2013;16r), at the end of which the project runs up against <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> transcript of

                            This work took up only a single leaf (42v&#x2013;42r), since the journey was unexpectedly cut short.</p>
                        <p>Since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> transcript, <ref type="apparatus" target="the_sound_of_the_sea_apparatus.html">&#x201C;The Sound of the Sea&#x201D;</ref>,

                            It is also possible, however, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> placed the poem at the end of the prospective itinerary after the actual journey was abandoned. It could even have predated the prospective itinerary.</p>

                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered the brief <ref type="apparatus" target="bowder_stone.html">Description of Bowder Stone</ref> in <placeName corresp="#Borrowdale">Borrowdale</placeName>, which the family had failed to reach.
                            Then, immmediately following, he entered <ref type="apparatus" target="minerals.html">&#x201C;Minerals&#x201D;</ref>, a catalog of 105 minerals (41v&#x2013;39r).</p>
                        <p>Later, probably in <date when="1831">1831</date> and/or <date when="1832">1832</date>, and in a cursive hand, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used the recto immediately following &#x201C;Minerals&#x201D; to start

                            despite the page number (p.34) <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered there, apparently because at this point the Notes ran up against the final page of

                            On 21v (p. 35), the Notes resume, taking up this page that contained no sketches. The Notes continue on 21r&#x2013;20v (pp. 36&#x2013;37), which do contain sketches, and the Notes overwrite a pencil sketch here, 
                            indicating again that the sketches predated them.</p> 
                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> continued the pagination on 20r&#x2013;19v with pp. 38&#x2013;39, but he wrote p. 38 upside down to the <ref type="apparatus" target="mineral_list_msjc_xxx6.html">Mineral List [MSJC uncertain 6]</ref> 
                            on this page, possibly indicating the latter&#x02BC;s preexistence; and he entered p. 39 on an otherwise blank page. He did not write page numbers on the following 2&#x2010;page spread (19r&#x2013;18v), 
                            which contains both <ref type="apparatus" target="wanting_msjc_xxx4.html">&#x201C;Wanting&#x201D; [MSJC uncertain 4]</ref> and the first two pages of
