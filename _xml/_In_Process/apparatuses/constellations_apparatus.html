               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.2. </span><span class="head">Title</span></h2>
               <p>In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS" title="Manuscripts">Manuscripts</a>), <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> centered <span class="titlem">“<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</span>”</span> above the column of lines. Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added “<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>” to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; and on a second line
                  below “<span class="caps">NORTHERN</span>”, he placed, awkwardly, in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem,
                  “<span class="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>”.</p>
               <p>While the addition of the trailing lines to the first fair‐copy subtitle might be
                  explained as pacing <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition of the poem—that is, his elaboration of the subtitle as he added constellations
                  from across the hemispheres—this possibility conflicts with the existence of a prior
                  draft. The belated additions could suggest, however, that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> came to understand the hemispheric positions of the constellations only after he
                  first drafted the poem. As discussed in <a class="link_ref" href="#STAGE" title="The Constellations as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education">“The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</a>, this inference is probably too extreme—contradicted, for example, by his clustering,
                  more or less, of constellation groups within the poem, such as the northern circumpolar
                  constellations and the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations. Nonetheless, the evolving title does testify broadly to <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as a marker of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs developing understanding and his desire to represent that development textually
                  and materially. The revision to the title may also have posed one motive for giving
                  up on this fair‐copy manuscript, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and using the same sheet to revise some of its lines (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a>).</p>
               <p>In the second surviving fair copy, in <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including allowing space to center
                  the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the
                  three lines as <span class="titlem">“<span class="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</span>”</span>.</p>
               <p>The fragment of draft of the poem, bound in <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>, lacks a title. Since the (unnumbered) lines in this manuscript start with line 27
                  as fair‐copied, presumably a sheet containing draft of preceding lines has been lost,
                  which may have included a title. The first state of the title, if any, is therefore
                  unknown, and we can only speculate about its relation to the apparent expansion of
                  the subtitle in the first fair copy. See <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Bound Manuscript</a>.</p>

                  <p>An apparently fragmentary manuscript, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“cepheus and bootes now”</span></span> is a 12.5 × 20 cm vertically folded sheet, written on all four sides in pencil, cursive
                     hand, with some substitutions written in ink, cursive hand. Although unsigned, and
                     the hand described as “unidentifed” in the finding aid of the <span class="titlem">Beinecke Library John Ruskin Collection</span>, the hand is distinctly <span class="persName">John Ruskin</span>ʼs early cursive.</p>
                  <p>The manuscript probably was bound into into <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a> by <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span>. Like the other contents of this miscellaneous collection, this item was separated
                     from its binding, whether prior to or as a result of <span class="persName">Charles Goodspeed</span>ʼs house fire. See <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>. Presently, at the <span class="placeName">Beinecke Library</span>, the manuscript is catalogued as part of the <span class="titlem">John Ruskin Collection, Series II: Manuscripts</span>, <span class="date">1826–1897</span>, subseries Unbound Manuscripts, “<span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>—Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated”. This identification
                     is mistaken: the folded sheet of <span class="titlem">“Constellations”</span> draft has been collected together with a fragment of <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft, which resembles the former in its paper and pencil cursive hand, and the collection
                     misidentified as consisting solely of manuscript of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>. The two projects were closely aligned, however; see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a>.</p>
               </div>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.4.2. </span><span class="head"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></span></h3>
                  <p>A facsimile of a manuscript—the whereabouts of the original being unknown—this item
                     consists of two photographs, which document a vertically folded sheet containing a
                     fair copy of the poem in pen‐and‐ink print lettering in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand, along with revisions of the text in his cursive hand, both ink and pencil.
                     The first‐stage fair copy was annotated in pencil by <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>. Possibly, the photographs were taken in the course of preparing the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a>; if so, the facsimile was not cited or reproduced in the edition. The photographs
                     are held by <span class="orgName">The Ruskin</span> at <span class="orgName">Lancaster University</span>, catalogued as <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>.</p>
                  <p>The folded sheet was photographed spread open and laid flat, with one photograph showing
                     pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), and the other photograph showing the reverse side,
                     pages 2 and 3 (from left to right). The manuscript reveals at least two major stages
                     of composition, a first stage of fair copying, and a second stage of heavy revision.
                     The fair copy occupies pages 1–2 (i.e., both sides of the first leaf), while the remaining
                     pages 3–4 (the second leaf) would originally have been left blank, prior to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs revisions. Subsequently, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> used this blank space, as well as the margins of pages 1–2, for revisions. Thus,
                     the facsimiles preserve a rare instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of
                     an early work by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> that he subsequently revised using the same sheet.</p>

               <p><span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> ascribed the poem to <span class="date">1827</span>, and they cited as sources the <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a> versions (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 2:535). No mention is made in the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a> of the manuscript captured by the photographs, <a class="link_ref" href="rft70_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">RF T70</span></a>. Judging by what little the editors wrote about the poem, they based their dating
                  on an association of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> with a poem they declare to have been contemporaneous, <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, although they leave the nature of this association unexplained (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 2:260 n. 1). Their method was sound but their conclusion inexact.</p>
               <p>The physical basis for associating the two poems is the similarity of the fragments
                  of rough draft in a pencil, cursive hand—so similar that the two drafts were apparently
                  mistaken as belonging to the same work (see <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>). For the place of this draft in the chronological sequence of drafting, revising,
                  and fair‐copying <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a>. Here it suffices to explain that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand in these draft manuscripts, which is a sprawling cursive in pencil with occasional
                  substitutions in pen‐and‐ink cursive, cannot be earlier than his first use of pen
                  and ink in <span class="date">April 1827</span>; and that the compositional history of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> places its <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft fragment, which contains lines of book 2 of the poem, no earlier than <span class="date">August 1827</span> and possibly starting as late as <span class="date">November 1827</span>, following the familyʼs return to <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> from the <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><span class="date">Tour of 1827</span></a> to <span class="placeName">Scotland</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-COMPARISON" title="Relation to Fair Copy of The Monastery">Relation to Draft of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>; <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#DATE"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Date</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication</a>).</p>
               <p>As another physical feature besides the similarity of the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> rough drafts linking <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> chronologically with the composition of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> (<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>) shares orthographic eccentricities of punctuation with the fair copy of books 1–2
                  of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> (<span class="titlem">MS III</span>). For the first twenty lines of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, each line ends with punctuation, occasionally a colon or full‐stop period, but most
                  frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl.
                  After twenty lines of this observant punctuation, the marks abruptly stop. This pattern
                  is identical to the punctuation in the fair copy of book 1 and the first eighty lines
                  of book 2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, in which almost every line of verse ends with a punctuation mark until the punctuation
                  gives out altogether. The pattern suggests that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have added the punctuation to these poems all at once, layering the marks over
                  top of the already fair‐copied text, only to grow tired of the exercise and quit.
                  Thereafter, in the fair copies of both poems, only an occasional punctuation mark
                  internal to a verse line appears—a comma or an apostrophe, which is regularly spaced
                  along with the surrounding characters, indicating that the mark was inserted in the
                  course of fair‐copying. Moreover, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs penmanship for the punctuation is similar in the two poemsʼ fair copies, with the
                  marks at the ends of lines of verse tending to float above the baseline (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-COMPARISON" title="Relation to Fair Copy of The Monastery">Relation to Fair Copy of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>).</p>
               <p>These practices contrast markedly with the very sparse punctuation in the fragmentary
                  rough drafts of both <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and with the fair‐copied poems comprising the anthology, <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>. The poems in the latter collection exhibit, moreover, an awkward learnerʼs stage
                  of penmanship, including tracing in ink over top of characters formed initially with
                  pencil. These factors put distance between the <span class="date">1827</span> <span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span> and the fair copies of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, which in the eccentricity of their punctuation resemble the usage in <a class="link_ref" href="eudosia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span></a> (<a class="link_ref" href="msiv_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IV</span></a>), which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> dated <span class="date">28 September 1828</span> on its title page. While the significance of that date within the compositional history
                  of <span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span> is obscure, the triangulation of that projectʼs punctuation practices with those
                  of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> appears to situate the latter two projects decisively in <span class="date">1828</span>.</p>
               <p>But when in <span class="date">1828</span>? If <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> based the first lines of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> on actual observation of the sky (or perhaps a demonstration at one of the so‐called
                  Lenten astronomy lectures [see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</a>), the alignment of planets and constellations described at the beginning of the poem
                  would have been observable in <span class="date">April–May 1828</span>, and not at all observable in <span class="date">1827</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#REAL-LIFE" title="The Constellations as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations">Discussion: “The Constellations” as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations</a>). This approximate dating would place draft and first fair‐copying of both <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> in the <span class="date">first quarter of 1828</span>—between the <a class="link_ref" href="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><span class="date">Tour of 1827</span></a>, which had been delayed until late in the year, and the <a class="link_ref" href="tour_of_1828">Tour of <span class="date">1828</span></a>, probably begun following <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="date">10 May</span> birthday but interrupted that same month by news of the death of <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs sister, <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_jessie_note.php"><span class="persName">Jessie</span></a>.</p>
               <p>Fair‐copying, and possibly initial composition, during the first months of <span class="date">1828</span> accord well with the placement of the second fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> entered in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> as the first poem in the <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</span></a>, immediately following <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>. While fair‐copying of that anthology cannot be dated precisely, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would not have waited long to make a fair copy incorporating the extensive revisions
                  to the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy [<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>]</a>); and by juxtaposing that poem as the first in the anthology with the end of the
                  second volume of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> emphasized astronomical learning as a shared interest in both the poem and the prose
                  tale. In the tale, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Harry</span> gives <span class="persName">Lucy</span> a drawing of the constellation <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> “as an introduction to astronomy” (p. 7). Moreover, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> maintained the astronomical theme in the poetry anthology by following <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> with a fair copy of <a class="link_ref" href="the_sun_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Sun”</span></a>, which he composed for <span class="date">New Yearʼs, 1 January 1828</span>. That <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs orthographic and punctuation practices appear to have progressed little by the
                  time he composed and fair‐copied <span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span> several months later—the same kind of catalog poem on a grandiose scale, fair‐copied
                  with the same kind or orthographic eccentricities and even weirder punctuation—can
                  be attributed to a long period of family mourning for the death of his aunt. His father
                  would have been preoccupied at home and in <span class="placeName">Perth</span>, making arrangements for his sisterʼs estate and orphaned children.</p>
               <p>Remaining open to question is whether composition of the initial draft of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> could have begun as early as a date in <span class="date">1827</span>, as <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> supposed. A factor that might argue for confining composition to the <span class="date">first quarter of 1828</span> is the possibility—admittedly questionable—that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> based his opening lines on planetariy observations that were visible in the sky over
                  <span class="placeName">London</span> only during those months, and not in <span class="date">1827</span>. Those details, which survive in the opening lines of the poem as fair‐copied, are
                  missing along with the first page(s) of draft from the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> manuscript. Thus, a genesis of the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft commencing, say, in <span class="date">the fourth quarter of 1827</span> can neither be ruled out nor confirmed.</p>

               <p>From surviving documents, a clear chronology is established based on revisions of
                  one document being incorporated in the next. Strikethroughs and substitutions in the
                  <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> pencil draft are incorporated into the copytext of the fair copy shown in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>; and strikethroughs and substitutions in the latter are in turn incorporated into
                  copytext for the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. This genetic history tracks a similar and roughly contemporaneous record
                  of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs development of the poem, <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, as witnessed in manuscripts likewise contained in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> and <span class="titlem">MS III</span>. Only <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, however, includes a stage of composition in which a fair copy is sacrificed to further
                  revision, at least insofar as surviving evidence can attest.</p>
               <p>As a stage of development in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs compositional methods, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> along with <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> represent a significant advance, which sprang from learning to use pen and ink in
                  <span class="date">April 1827</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions,
                  and insertions, both in pencil and in ink, most of them in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand. At least one of the interventions is in the hand of <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>, but this is limited to correcting a mistranscription from the preceding draft. <span class="persName">Margaret</span> proofread; she did not herself revise <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs text, unless she did so verbally. Evidence suggests that she did censor, however,
                  by marking text she deemed inappropriate in some way. Thus, these states of text open
                  a window onto <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs compositional process as an interaction with his audience, his parents—with his
                  mother acting as proofreader and, to a limited extent, as editor. Perhaps these states
                  of draft and fair copy were preserved for this reason, that they recorded a distinct
                  stage of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs learning to write as an interactive process.</p>
               <p><span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is also significant for its scope. It is one among several projects of <span class="date">1828</span> which are marked by their ambition and length, including the versification of <span class="persName">Scott</span>ʼs novel, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>, and the “poem on the universe”, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Eudosia</span></span>. Of these three, only <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> reached a conclusion.</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.6.1. </span><span class="head">Earliest Surviving Draft, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> (<span class="titlem">MS IA</span>)</span></h3>
                  <p>This pencil‐on‐paper manuscript in a cursive hand, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS-MSIA" title="MS IA">Manuscripts: <span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>), begins at line 27 of the poem as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, and from that point the text extends for 49 lines on all four sides of a vertically
                     folded sheet. The surviving text starts at the top of 1r of the manuscript, lacking
                     title or context, evidently in mid‐career of the poem. While nothing definitive can
                     be determined about whether this manuscript is missing a witness to the original beginning
                     of its text—nor can anything be determined about what that opening text would have
                     consisted of—it is likely that the missing draft closely matched the text as fair‐copied
                     in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, given the consistency of the proofreading marks from start to finish on that later
                     manuscript (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY" title="First Fair Copy (RF T70)">First Fair Copy [<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>]</a>).</p>
                  <p>It is possible that an opening piece of the manuscript, now missing, was originally
                     bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, but that this piece was lost and its survival or whereabouts untraceable, given
                     the current damaged and unbound state of the collection (see <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php#CONTENTS"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span>: Contents, <span style="font-style:italic">b</span></a>).</p>
                  <div class="sub-subsection" id="COMPPUB-EARLIEST-DRAFT-HAND">
                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.1.1. </span><span class="head">Hand</span></h4>
                     <p>The hand is recognizably <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs cursive, identical to the cursive hand in his holograph <a class="link_ref" href="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem"><span class="date">May 1827</span> letter to his father</span></a>. The latter document—the earliest surviving example of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs use of pen and ink—is composed almost entirely in cursive using a pencil, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> exchanging the pencil for pen and ink only for the closing of the letter, which he
                        also wrote in cursive. In the letter, he continued beyond his signature by appending
                        two poems, still using a pen but switching to print lettering. Similarly here, at
                        the end of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> draft, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> switches from pencil to pen and ink for a closing, “I end”, written in cursive. Perhaps
                        he reserved pen and ink for closings in these early cursive manuscripts because the
                        ink suggested to him a sense of finality.</p>
                     <p>In this draft version of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also uses pen and ink for a few minor revisions, making substitutions in ink by striking
                        through pencil draft with a pen and writing the substituted word above. This usage,
                        too, may have suggested finality to him, an act of polishing the verse. Alternatively
                        or additionally—and one suspects this also to have been the case in the <span class="titlem"><span class="date">1827</span> letter</span>—<span class="persName">Ruskin</span> felt more at ease manually in dipping a pen to form the strokes of print letters
                        as compared with maintaining the flow of cursive. With respect to penmanship, then,
                        the constrained use of pen and ink in <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> represents an earlier developmental stage, comparable to the <span class="titlem"><span class="date">1827</span> letter to his father</span>, whereas the first fair copy, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, shows him using a pen not only for extensive print‐lettering but also for longer
                        cursive phrases, albeit sometimes over top of the same phrases in pencil, so far as
                        one can tell from the photograph.</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.1.2. </span><span class="head">Two Successive Endings</span></h4>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears to have ended the poem twice in draft. At the bottom of the inside recto
                        page of the folded sheet (2r), he wrote “end” in pencil, cursive; and on the same
                        line, to the left, he wrote “I end” in ink, also cursive—the ink <span style="font-style:italic">end</span> being presumably the second of the two, though the order cannot be distinguished
                        from the material evidence. This <span style="font-style:italic">finis</span> follows <span class="name">Capricornus (the Sea Goat)</span>, the last‐listed of the constellations in all three manuscript versions (line 64
                        in the second fair copy, <span class="titlem">MS III</span>): “and the <span class="name">goat</span> that is formed in the arched sky“. In draft as well as fair copy, this line carries
                        lexical markers of closure—for one, by beginning the line uniquely with <span style="font-style:italic">and</span>, as if to say, <span style="font-style:italic">and finally</span>; and for another, by ending the line with a flourish supplied by the quaintly poetic
                        modifier <span style="font-style:italic">arched</span> (for sources of this poetic diction, see the contextual gloss for <span style="font-style:italic">arched sky</span> in the witnesses).</p>
                     <p>Another ending is found on the back of the folded sheet (2v), where <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> added nine lines beyond the ending at the foot of the preceding page (2r). Below
                        these nine addtional lines, on a separate line by itself, he again wrote “I end” in
                        pencil longhand; and to the right of that <span style="font-style:italic">finis</span>, he wrote “I end” in ink longhand. (Again, presumably the phrase written in ink was
                        subsequent to the pencil phrase, but the evidence is indeterminate.) These nine lines
                        form the peroration of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>.</p>
                     <p>As originally concluded, therefore, if the “I end” on 2r truly indicates an earlier
                        intention, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“<span class="name">cepheus</span> and <span class="name">bootes</span> now”</span></span> represented a less ambitious work poetically, aiming solely at a catalogue of stars
                        without any summary reflection on its meaning. In this respect, the first version
                        of the poem resembles lists of constellations that could be found in print sources
                        on astronomy aimed specifically at children, such as <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mary Martha Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>), although even <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs lists include implicit commentary in the form of Bible verses (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs chief original contribution to such elementary lists consists in his epithets describing
                        some of the constellations he names. The version of the poem ending with <span class="name">Capricornus</span> is an aesthetic, poetic exercise more than a religious or scientific one.</p>
                     <p>With the addition of the nine‐line peroration, the poem is complicated by a contest
                        between “history” and “virtue”. The meaning and implications of this contest give
                        <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> trouble, as he revises these concluding lines after having fair‐copied them in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY" title="First Fair Copy (RF T70)">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy (<span class="titlem">RF T70</span>)</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Discussion: Knowledge versus Christian Faith</a>).</p>

                     <p>As remarked in <a class="link_ref" href="#DATE" title="Date">Date</a>, the physical appearance of this manuscript of draft for <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> strikingly resembles another item of draft that was probably once bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, some surviving draft for <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>, which begins <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“now must we leave poor martin there”</span></span> (lines 29–62 of book 2 of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs versification of <span class="persName">Scott</span>ʼs novel, as fair‐copied and numbered in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>). The two poemsʼ drafts resemble one another in the size and kind of paper used for
                        the physical document, and in the sprawling cursive hand used for the pencil draft.
                        A difference between the manuscripts is that <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft contains no substitutions, either in pencil or in pen and ink, as does <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> draft in ink over top of the pencil. (See <a class="link_ref" href="#MAJORMS-MSIA" title="MS IA">Manuscripts: <span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>; at the <span class="placeName">Beinecke Library</span>, the two manuscripts are now (mistakenly) catalogued together as “<span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span>—Manuscript, in an unidentified hand, of passages of verse, undated”, in the subseries,
                        Unbound Manuscripts, of the <span class="titlem">John Ruskin Collection, Series II: Manuscripts</span>, <span class="date">1826–1897</span>.)</p>
                     <p>Another item of <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft, <span class="titlem"><span class="titlem">“come on good horse and let us see”</span></span>, which was definitely bound in <span class="titlem">MS IA</span>, and which contains lines 14–62 of book 3 of the poem as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, is written in a cursive hand, one portion in pencil and another in ink. The ink
                        cursive hand resembles that used for the revisions of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> version of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>. The physical evidence thus conforms to the probable dating of the <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> draft, which is approximately <span class="date">late 1827 through the first quarter or half of 1828</span> (with an additional stage of composition and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> possibly extending into <span class="date">1828–29</span>; see <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication</a>).</p>

                     draft, which is evidently missing its original opening. As fair‐copied, however, these
                     lines probably do adhere to the original context, since <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> contains markings from the start of the text to the end that can be interpreted as

                     <p>The original fair‐copy text of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> shown in the photographs is print‐lettered using pen and ink, thus dating the manuscript
                        as no earlier than <span class="date">April–May 1827</span>, when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> first adopted that medium, and probably later in that year or the next, when he had
                        gained more facility. While the dimensions of the original manuscript shown in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> cannot be measured based on a photograph, the lettering appears to be smaller and
                        more uniform compared to the large, spiky, uneven pen‐and‐ink print lettering that
                        characterizes <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs dateable first efforts, such as <a class="link_ref" href="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="wales_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Wales”</span></a> and some poems in the anthology <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>.

Vol 2”</span></a>, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> traced using pen and ink over top of pencil lettering, the characters in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> appear free of any underlying pencil guidelines, although the resolution of the photograph
                        may not have sufficed to capture that level of detail (see <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>).</p>

                     <p>As remarked in <a class="link_ref" href="#DATE" title="Date">Date</a>, physical similarities connect the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> with the fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, just as resemblances between the two poemsʼ drafts point to an associated process
                        of composition (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-EARLIEST-DRAFT-COMPARISON" title="Relation to Draft of The Monastery">Relation to Draft of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span></a>). The treatment of text in books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> has more in common with <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> as fair‐copied in <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> than it does either with the work that immediately precedes the <span class="titlem">“Monastery”</span> poem in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>—namely, the anthology <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>, which dates from earlier in <span class="date">1827</span>—or with the continuing fair copy of books 3–4 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, which is set apart from books 1–2 in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB1"><span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>: Composition and Publication—Stage One of Composition</a>). For both <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2, and the first fair copy of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="titlem">RF T70</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> adopted a comparatively miniscule print‐lettering, resembling a serif typeface.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, in the <span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span> poems from earlier in <span class="date">1827</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> avoided punctuation almost entirely, whereas punctuation does characterize the fair
                        copies of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, books 1–2. In both, moreover. the punctuation marks share eccentricities suggesting
                        a learner who has an uncertain grasp of the grammatical and rhetorical function of
                        punctuation but who is excited—at least initially—by the physical appearance of the
                        marks on the page. Almost every line of books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> is punctuated, regardless of grammatical or rhetorical need, and the marks are used
                        exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but misinformed observance abruptly
                        ceases at book 2, line 80, of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>, at the top of page 79 of the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. Just so, the end of every line of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> <span class="titlem">“Constellations”</span> fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, where the practice abruptly
                        stops.</p>
                     <p>Where used, the punctuation in the opening lines of both fair‐copied poems often seems
                        arbitrary. While the full‐stop periods make grammatical sense in most instances, the
                        commas, colons, and (most prominently in <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span>) an upside‐down semicolon seem interchangeable with one another in their rhetorical
                        use and placement. Both these fair copies give the impression that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> layered over the texts with bookish punctuation to convey the appearance of print,
                        without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks. Finally,
                        in both fair copies, the punctuation markup stops abruptly at an arbitrary place,
                        suggesting that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> grew tired of the exercise, ran out of time, or was informed about his erroneous
                        usage.</p>
                     <p>The oddities of punctuation, then, in both manuscripts should be classed with other
                        attempts to give the fair copy an appearance of print. The first letters of each line
                        are capitalized, and the first word of line 1 is rendered in all capitals. As another
                        bookish touch, lines are numbered by fives in the left margin.</p>
                     <p>Despite these preoccupations with penmanship and presentation, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> and books 1–2 of <span class="titlem">“The Monastery”</span> are ambitious and interesting projects, a leap beyond the lyric‐descriptive poems
                        fair‐copied in pen‐and‐ink a half‐year earlier—<a class="link_ref" href="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Spring: Blank Verse”</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="wales_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Wales”</span></a>, and the poems comprising <a class="link_ref" href="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“poetry discriptive”</span></a>. A half‐year later than <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, the catalogue poem, <a class="link_ref" href="eudosia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Eudosia”</span></a> nominally maintains the ambition—a “poem on the universe”—yet seems to attempt less.
                        Perhaps the disturbing events that intervened—the Ruskinsʼ aborted <a class="link_ref" href="tour_of_1828_note.php">Tour of <span class="date">1828</span></a>, which was cut short by the death of <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_jessie_note.php"><span class="persName">Jessie Richardson</span></a>, the period of mourning, and the resettlement of <span class="persName">Jessie</span>ʼs orphaned children, including the adoption of <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_mary_note.php"><span class="persName">Mary Richardson</span></a> into the <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> household—caused a hiatus in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs learning.</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.6.2.3. </span><span class="head">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</span></h4>
                     <p>An especially valuable feature of the <span class="titlem">RF T70</span> fair copy is the evidence of <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs participation in the compositional process. At line 54 of the poem, <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs handwriting can be unmistakably identified. The intervention is a penciled correction
                        of a mistranscription of a word from the draft text, substituting the word “bear”
                        for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs erroneously copied “appear”. The insertion is accompanied by a penciled deletion
                        of “appear” using a style of strikethrough that differs from all other instances of
                        strikethrough, save one at line 30 (see the textual gloss hanging from line 54, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#MONOCEROSGLOSS">“The horn the <span class="name">unicorn</span> doth appear”</a>). From this evidence, one may infer that a series of other pencil marks on the manuscript—a
                        diagonal or double diagonal line at the end of each line of verse—records <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs proofreading of the fair copy against the draft manuscript. That these diagonal
                        marks were <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs is substantiated by their replacement by <span style="font-style:italic">×</span> marks next to certain lines of verse, which evidently signaled her concerns, prompting
                        revisions by <span class="persName">John</span>. It is possible that the proofreading marks were made by somebody other than <span class="persName">Margaret</span>—<span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>, for example—but his handwriting does not otherwise appear in the manuscript.</p>
                     <p>While we can only infer <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs objections based on the content of the original verse and on <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs substitution, the topics that drew her censorship seem evident enough. An <span style="font-style:italic">×</span> by the constellation <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> suggests that the image was deemed too horrible. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substituted in the margin a line about the constellation, <span class="name">Herschelʼs Telescope</span>, replacing the ancient wonder of <span class="persName">Medusa</span>ʼs stare, with which the pagan hero <span class="persName">Perseus</span> wreaked violence and retribution, with the modern wonder of the seven‐foot optical
                        instrument, with which the British scientific hero, <span class="persName">William Herschel</span> (<span class="date">1738–1822</span>), discovered the planet <span class="name">Uranus</span>. Even the feline violence of the <span class="name">“furious lynx”</span> was tagged to be tamed, replaced by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> with its “keen‐eyed” attribute.</p>
                     <p>A different kind of horror apparently was suggested by the constellation <span class="name">Altar</span>, which would have evoked dangerously pagan practices. This line having prompted double
                        <span style="font-style:italic">×</span>s for revision, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substituted the Scriptural epithet, “gods fire”, implying that the “strange fire”
                        of paganism would be snuffed out (<span class="titlem">Lev.</span> 10). One other change was demanded to prevent a jest from disturbing the gravity
                        of the subject; and some lines were marked with an <span style="font-style:italic">×</span> for no obvious reason other than to improve the verse: the trite and redundant epithet
                        “pretty” was rejected, and an imperfect rhyme needed mending (see textual and contextual
                        glosses hanging from line 14, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#TELESCOPIUMGLOSS">“Then the dread medusas head”</a>; line 30, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LYNXTEXTGLOSS">“After that the furious <span class="name">lynx</span>”</a>; line 44, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#GODSFIREGLOSS">“Next to it the <span class="name">altar</span>”</a>; lines 17 and 64, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LEPUSTEXTGLOSS">“After that doth come the <span class="name">lyre</span>” and “I wish I had not observed the <span class="name">lyre</span>”</a>; lines 12 and 40, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#CYGNUSTEXTGLOSS">“Then the very pretty <span class="name">swan</span>”</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#GRUSTEXTGLOSS">“Next the very pretty <span class="name">crane</span>”</a>; lines 41 and 42, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#DOWNTEXTGLOSS">“<span class="name">Antinoüs</span> and <span class="name">arrow</span> soon” and “After it the <span class="name">southern crown</span>”</a>).</p>
                     <p>Each of the lines marked with an <span style="font-style:italic">×</span> prompted a revision in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand. In most cases, he drafted the revision in the margin adjacent to the line,
                        first writing in cursive with a pencil, and then in some cases writing in cursive
                        with pen and ink to revise the revision over top of the pencil. Insofar as the available
                        evidence shows, then, the revisions were invented by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>; no other hand is present in the draft revision, although of course we cannot know
                        what discussion, if any, surrounded his decisions. We also cannot know for certain
                        at what point in the fair‐copying the process of proofreading and marking for revision
                        began. Since the poem is fair‐copied through to the end of the extant <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft, it is reasonable to conclude that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> completed the fair‐copying before it was subjected to scrutiny, although some finishing
                        touches are incomplete: the marginal line numbering halts after line 60, with fifteen
                        remaining lines left unnumbered; and as already remarked, most punctuation, particularly
                        at the ends of verse lines, is abandoned after about line 20. Perhaps at this final
                        stage of touch‐up, <span class="persName">Margaret</span> (or perhaps <span class="persName">Margaret</span> as well as <span class="persName">John James</span>) intervened with a review. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may even have been surprised by the demand for revision. The manuscript is unique
                        among the juvenilia as a fair copy that was subjected to a critique, resulting in
                        revisions made on the fair copy itself.</p>
                     <p>It may be no coincidence that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs marginal line‐numbering was arrested at line 60, since at lines 57–60 the most
                        extensive single passage is flagged for revision, with a long diagonal line and <span style="font-style:italic">×</span>s marking a quatrain about the constellation <span class="name">Libra (the Scales)</span>, ending in a mention of the <span class="name">Milky Way</span>. The passage may have been flagged merely because the original lines, both in draft
                        and fair copy, are somewhat incoherent: the lines develop a paradox of the <span class="name">Scales</span> being capable of weighing “nothing” yet containing a “thousand more”—more even than
                        “the beautiful <span class="name">milky way</span>”—but with the implied object, <span style="font-style:italic">stars</span>, being absent from the lines. The omission may or may not have been deliberate, but
                        instead of revising to clarify the paradoxical conceit, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> substituted a couplet that veers to a different topic altogether—<span class="name">the Scales</span> as a symbol of justice, which was a traditional treatment of this constellation,
                        particularly in Roman astronomy (see the contextual gloss hanging from line 57, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#LIBRAGLOSS">“The scales that nothing to weigh would bear”</a>).</p>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> began the revision of the <span class="name">Libra</span> quatrain in pencil at the bottom of the inner fold of the pamphlet, sprawling across
                        the fold to the opposite recto (pp. 3–4, which would have been blank at that point),
                        and coninuing onto the back of the pamphlet (p. 4). Nine lines of cursive pencil text
                        wrestle with the topic of justice (see the textual gloss hanging from lines 57–60,
                        <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LIBRATEXTGLOSS">“that nothing to weigh would bear / . . . / More than than the beautiful milky way”</a>); and then, at the bottom and top‐right of the inner fold (pp. 3–4), he overwrote
                        this pencil draft with pen and ink, still in cursive, recasting the lines on <span class="name">Libra</span> as the couplet they became in the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy. Next, on remaining space in the middle of the inner recto (p. 3), and
                        over top of pencil draft on the back (p. 4), <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> drafted in pen and ink new lines on the <span class="name">Milky Way</span> as they appear in the <span class="titlem">MS III</span> fair copy (lines 65–69). In these new lines, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> expanded on the <span class="name">Milky Way</span>, previously mentioned only as a comparison with what stars could be weighed in <span class="name">Libra</span>ʼs scales. Now he elaborated on the myth of the <span class="name">Milky Way</span> as a roadway to heaven for the heroes of mythology. In connection with this image,
                        his revisions reveal that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> wrestled, not just with squeamish objections to violent or pagan imagery, but with
                        broader concepts such as the relation between “history” (revised to “knowledge”) and
                        “virtue” (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Discussion—Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>).</p>

This label does not necessarily
                     signify that this poetry anthology (along with the preceding <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.7. </span><span class="head">Discussion</span></h2>
               <p><span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, like other poems and prose by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> of <span class="date">1826–28</span> that mention the fixed stars and other astronomical phenomena, was composed in context
                  of popular education in astronomy for adults and children in the <span class="date">early nineteenth century</span> in <span class="placeName">Britain</span>. This movement is surveyed in <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</a>, and parts of the following discussion are keyed to the context of that broader note.</p>
               <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs purpose in <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is more poetic than scientific. As his most original contribution to the versified
                  catalogue of constellations that constitutes the poem, he assigns descriptive epithets
                  to several of the constellation names. While the poem is not entirely lacking in the
                  influence of childrenʼs scientific lessons in astronomy, which were typical the period,
                  <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> admitted in a note added belatedly in the compositional process—the note first appears
                  in the <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-2D-FAIR-COPY" title="Second Fair Copy (MS III)">Second Fair Copy</a>—that his arrangement of constellation names is unsystematic with respect to the starsʼ
                  actual positions in the sky. The note is less disingenuous than it seems and may play
                  down a significant achievement in spatial imagination (see <a class="link_ref" href="#PROJECT" title="The Constellations as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>); nonetheless, the poem represents an early and playful stage in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs ongoing astromical education (see <a class="link_ref" href="#STAGE" title="The Constellations as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education">“The Constellations” as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</a>).</p>
               <p>As a stage of learning, the poem is somewhat elusive in allowing one to gauge the
                  extent of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs knowledge about the constellations and their myths. He derived some of his epithets,
                  not from mythology, but from fables—particularly stories that could apply to constellations
                  representing beasts and birds (see <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>). Given his motherʼs censorship described in <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR" title="Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the FairCopying Process"><span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have avoided expressing some of what he knew about myth. Regrettably, to understand
                  his exposure, the identity of a “lesson book” on astronomy mentioned in <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span></a> remains conjectural, but on the evidence of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> he must have had access to an up‐to‐date source like a recent star atlas, which likely
                  would have relayed legendary as well as scientific information (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES.php">Astronomical Education: Print Sources of Astronomical Education—Star Atlases</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>). There has also survived a celestial globe belonging to the family, which is dated
                  ca. 1820, the decade when Ruskin composed "The Constellations", and which was manufactured
                  by <a class="link_ref" href="smith_and_son_cartographer_note.php">Smith &amp; Son</a> (17 cm x 88.9 mm, object GA2197, Southwark Heritage Centre and Walworth Library,
                  London).</p>
               <p>In the three diplomatically edited texts of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, contextual glosses attached to each of the constellation names summarize the information
                  commonly available in popular works on astronomy published in the <span class="date">1820s</span>. The information includes the position in the sky and the periods of the year when
                  each constellation was visible, if at all, in the night sky above <span class="placeName">London</span>; the legends, if any, associated with each constellation, especially the more commonly
                  known Greek and Roman myths connected with ancient constellations; and the origin
                  of comparatively more recent constellations and their significance for British amateur
                  astronomers in the <span class="date">early nineteenth century</span> (e.g., at this time, the heavens were mapped with a large number of constellations
                  invented between the <span class="date">sixteenth and eighteenth centuries</span>, which became obsolete in the later <span class="date">nineteenth and twentieth centuries</span>; also, some constellations were typically treated as pairs, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> for some reason separated and named singly in his poem). Given the uncertainty about
                  <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sources of information, the glosses survey what <span class="persName">he</span> may have known, not what he necessarily did know or was allowed or encouraged to
                  learn.</p>
               <p>For an overview of the kinds of print sources available to amateur astronomers in

                  and punctuated with holes in the place of the starsʼ positions, which glowed when

                  <p>Following this introductory reading, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs period of composition, revision, and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> in <span class="date">1827–28</span> would have accompanied or shortly followed his reading of additional educational
                     dialogues on astronomy, which pick up where the conversations in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> leave off—namely, the astronomy of the constellations both as a discipline of practical
                     and scientific reasoning and as an appreciation of beauty. This stage of reading consisted
                     at least of volume 2, “Of Astronomy”, of <a class="link_ref" href="joyce_jeremiah_note.php"><span class="persName">Jeremiah Joyce</span></a>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>; and of passages in <a class="link_ref" href="day_thomas_note.php"><span class="persName">Thomas Day</span></a>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, in which the Tutor, <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>, draws on <span class="persName">Harry Sandford</span>ʼs practical experience in reading the night sky to spark <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>ʼs admiration for the beauty and wonder of the fixed stars (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES">Astronomical Education: Scientific and Practical Astronomical Dialogues</a>). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> himself identifies his use of these latter sources for astronomical education in

Vol I”</span></a>.</p>
                  <p>It is possible that this first stage of astronomical education, preceding and contemporaneous
                     with the composition of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, also relied on one of the primers in astronomical science written for children in
                     the first third of the century (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>). This kind of text was more likely to emphasize memorization rather than dialogic
                     exchange; and primers of the <span class="date">1820s</span> for young readers perhaps more emphatically staked the purpose of astronomical study
                     in religious admiration rather than practical and scientific reasoning. In its form,
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem embodies the memorization exercises typical of these primers, while its rhetoric
                     reflects no particular agenda of piety—at least not initially so. Arguably, that agenda
                     is layered over the initial version, at the urging of <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs flags for revision (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR" title="Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the FairCopying Process">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="#CATALOGUE" title="The Genre of The Constellations">The Genre of “The Constellations”</a>).</p>
                  <p>By <span class="date">1828–29</span>, one year beyond the composition, revision, and fair‐copying of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> recorded statistical astronomical information in his <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III”</span></a>, which was typically found in sophisticated print sources known as <span style="font-style:italic">star atlases</span>, although such information was also plagiarized from star atlases in the more advanced
                     astronomical primers for young readers, such as <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>. The identity of this type of source or sources used by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> remains elusive (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES">Astromical Education: Star Atlases</a>). Whatever the source, while <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs presentation of astronomical information in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

                  <p>As indicated by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sources, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> is a bookish poem. Even in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books, however, <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupilsʼ attention to the evening
                     sky. To what extent, if any, might <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs composition of his poem have involved actual astronomical observation?</p>
                  <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> opens his poem by hailing <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span>. In the instructional dialogues, planets—the <span style="font-style:italic">wandering stars</span>—are not an obvious starting point for astronomy lessons in the open air (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES">Astronomical Education: Instructional Dialogues on Astronomy</a>). Fictional tutors typically begin by asking pupils to find the most commonly recognizable
                     constellation or <span style="font-style:italic">fixed stars</span>, <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>. As suggested by an earlier poem, <a class="link_ref" href="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Glen of Glenfarg” (“Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill”)</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> had long been able to orient himself to that formation in the night sky. Nonetheless,
                     equally striking objects for young stargazers are <span class="name">Venus</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic">Morning Star</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Evening Star</span>, and <span class="name">Mars</span>, the red planet. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have chosen those planets to begin his poem because they are famously beautiful
                     and striking celestial bodies with familiar mythological associations. In his books,
                     <span class="name">Venus</span> was singled out for the planetʼs beauty (see <a class="link_ref" href="#PROJECT" title="The Constellations as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>). It is also possible that the particular alignment described in the poem—<span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span> visible on the ecliptic, with the constellation <span class="name">Orion</span> setting on the horizon—indicates an actual and datable observation.</p>
                  <p>In the poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> positions <span class="name">Venus</span> specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <span class="name">Orion</span>. According to a digital‐age star chart, the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sky &amp; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</span></span>, <span class="name">Venus</span> would have been visible from <span class="placeName">London</span> as the Evening Star, setting in the west along with <span class="name">Orion</span> during <span class="date">April–June 1828</span>. (During that period, another bright object that was visible low in the evening sky,
                     which an observer might have confused with a planet, was <span class="name">Sirius or the “Dog Star”</span>, in the constellation <span class="name">Canis Major</span>. It is positioned directly below <span class="name">Orion</span>.) During those same months, <span class="name">Mars</span> would have risen from the east, traveling “high . . . [in] the sky”, as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem says, a few hours after <span class="name">Venus</span> had set (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SKYANDTELESCOPE"><span class="titlem">Sky &amp; Telescope, Interactive Star Chart and Celestial Almanac</span></a>, accessed <span class="date">12 April 2023</span>).</p>
                  <p>This calculation accords with tables of constellations in the <span class="titlem">“Calendarium Stellaris”</span>, subtitled an “Easy Method of Finding the Stars for Every Month of the Year”, in
                     the <span class="date">1825</span> edition of <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span>. Describing the sky viewed from <span class="placeName">London</span> each month “in about the middle of . . . the month, at half‐past nine oʼclock in
                     the evening”, the <span class="titlem">Calendarium</span> lists <span class="name">Orion</span> as appearing “nearly on the meridian” in January and moving toward the “space between
                     “W. by S. and S.W. by W.” by March. The constellation is omitted from the listings
                     for April, presumably because it would have set by 9:00 <span style="font-variant: small-caps">P.M.</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 161, 167, 168–69). The digital star chart shows that <span class="name">Orion</span> set in the late‐afternoon dusk of <span class="date">April 1828</span>, preceded by <span class="name">Venus</span>; and as the weeks advanced, <span class="name">Venus</span> set later in the evening than <span class="name">Orion</span>, which had vanished by sunset. A comparison of findings using the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sky &amp; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</span></span> with the <span class="titlem">Calendarium</span> identifies <span class="date">April 1828</span>, therefore, as the period when the tracks of <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span> overlapped with a sighting of <span class="name">Orion</span>. According to the digital star chart, this configuration was never visible at dusk
                     or nighttime in <span class="date">1827</span>.</p>
                  <p>Tending to confirm these observations in the first quarter of the year, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> includes the southern constellation, <span class="name">Crater</span>, in the poem, which is visible from the latitude of <span class="placeName">London</span> in the evening sky, annually from December through May. The poem also names southern
                     constellations that cannot be viewed from the latitude of <span class="placeName">London</span> at all, but <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs choice of these appears related to a sentiment for their legends. The choice of
                     <span class="name">Crater</span> seems arbitrary other than its regular rising and setting in the southern sky, culminating
                     in April (see <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#CRATERGLOSS"><span class="name">Crater</span>, contextual gloss</a>).</p>
                  <p>It is possible, then, that actual observations of the evening sky lay behind the composition
                     of the poemʼs introductory lines, a possibility that aligns with the evidence in <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB" title="Composition and Publication">Composition and Publication</a> supporting the year <span class="date">1828</span> as a probable period of composition or at least revision of the poem. (Since the
                     partially surviving manuscript of the <span class="titlem">MS IA</span> draft lacks the opening lines, the possibility of an earlier date in <span class="date">1827</span> for the inception of the poem remains open.) April–May was typically the period when
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> prepared poems for his fatherʼs birthday in May, thus suggesting an occasion as well
                     as a terminus a quo for the start of either composition or revision of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>.</p>
                  <p>Whether or not <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> looked up from his books to the sky for an inspiration to open his poem, he was also
                     prompted to admiration of <span class="name">Orion</span> by <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs fictional character, <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>, who, “looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he
                     . . . begged to know the name”. On learning it was called <span class="name">Orion</span>, he “was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation,
                     that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised
                     to see that it seemed to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west; and that
                     all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction”.
                     In the opening four lines of the poem, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> echoes the alliterative modifiers with which <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> describes the experience of gazing at the constellations: “‘I should think there
                     would be a very great pleasure in observing such a number of <span style="font-style:italic">glorious</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">glittering</span> bodies as are now above us’” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 187–88, 165 [emphasis added]; see also <a class="link_ref" href="#PROJECT" title="The Constellations as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</a>).</p>
                  <p>Following <span class="name">Orion</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> goes on to name circumpolar constellations—all “northern” constellations, as announced
                     in the first part of the poemʼs subtitle (lines 7–14; see <a class="link_ref" href="#TITLE" title="Title">Title</a>). As possible real sightings, it is striking that he begins with <span class="name">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</span>, which likewise tops the list for April in the <span class="titlem">“Calendarium Stellaris”</span>, that constellation being positioned “in the zenith”. Moreover, the “lower star in
                     the tail” of the bear “at about 65 degrees high” is “one of those called <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Charlesʼs Wain</span></span>”—the next to be identified by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, albeit not surprisingly. All six of the following constellations named in the poem
                     were also visible in April, according to the <span class="titlem">Calendarium</span>: <span class="name">Draco (the Dragon)</span>, <span class="name">Coma Berenices (Bereniceʼs Hair)</span>, <span class="name">Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown)</span>, Cygnus (the Swan). <span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span>, and <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 168–69). Only with <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii (<span class="persName">Herschel</span>ʼs Telescope)</span> does <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> depart from naming what he could actually have viewed overhead in <span class="date">April 1828</span>, and that choice was a substitution evidently to placate alarm over <span class="name">Medusaʼs Head</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR" title="Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the FairCopying Process">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a>).</p>
                  <p>Hereafter in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, the sequence of constellations appears more erratic, with the repeated “next
                     comes” ceasing necessarily to refer to star formations that are adjacent in the dome
                     of the sky. In the second fair copy, in <span class="titlem">MS III</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> forestalled objections by adding a note with a caveat: “These constellations though
                     they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”. The note is not attached by
                     an asterisk to a particular line in the poem, seeming to refer to the whole, so it
                     is unclear whether he would have exempted the first fourteen lines from observable
                     phenomena.</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.7.3. </span><span class="head">The Genre of “The Constellations”</span></h3>
                  <p>The genre of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, at its most basic level, is a catalogue poem, simply naming the constellations.
                     As a list, the poem shares some characteristics with an astronomical primer, <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span> (<span class="date">1817</span>)</a> by <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> (<span class="date">1775–1851</span>). While no record of this book or a work like it is recorded in the Ruskin family
                     library, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> introduces the topic of the constellations with a heading identical to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs main title, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, and follows that heading with subdivisions, each with its own heading, that sorts
                     the constellations into “Constellations in the Zodiac or Ecliptic”, “Constellations
                     to the North of the Ecliptic”, and “Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic”—subdivisions
                     that resemble <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs subtitle to his poem, “Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern”.</p>
                  <p>As a catalogue poem, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> perhaps reflects <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs pedagogical assumption that a childʼs act of naming and identifying heavenly bodies
                     precedes understanding of the physical laws that govern their motion, and the development
                     of a spatial imagination required to grasp the relation of the earthʼs revolutions
                     to the apparent motion of the constellations across the sky. In each of her hemispheric
                     categories, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> merely lists the names of constellations—the Latin name followed by its English translation—which
                     matches <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs procedure in his catalogue poem, except for his added embellishment of a poetic
                     epithet to describe some of the constellations. <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> provides no information about each of the constellations; rather, she annotates the
                     respective lists with a Bible verse that mentions the stars and praises the <span class="persName">Creator</span>.</p>
                  <p>As a reflection of a <a class="link_ref" href="#STAGE" title="The Constellations as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education">stage of astronomical education</a>, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> obviously represents an elementary exercise in naming and memorization. Unlike <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span>ʼs lists of names, however, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs catalogue is not encased within Scripture quotations that monitor the aim of memorization
                     with expressions of piety. Rather, the compositional history suggests that moral and
                     Christian (but not specifically Scriptural) admonition was layered onto the poem to
                     contain the paganism presented by its list of names. See <a class="link_ref" href="#MYTHS" title="Knowledge versus Christian Faith The Problem of Mythology">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</a>.</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.7.4. </span><span class="head">“The Constellations” as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</span></h3>
                  <p>“These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky”.
                     This note, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> added to the second fair copy, can be read as an admission of failure to recognize
                     the astronomerʼs mapping of the visible galaxy. Turn the sentence around—“These constellations,
                     though not next in the sky, are next in this poetry”—and the statement stakes a claim
                     for poetic form.</p>
                  <p>As an aesthetic project, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span> derives from an exercise in spatial perception and translating that perception into
                     a graphic representation. In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span>, <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span> proposes to <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> to memorize the positions of the stars forming the constellations by “‘mak[ing] a
                     mark upon . . . paper for every star in <span class="name">Charlesʼ Wain</span>; and I would place the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and I would
                     entreat you to write the names for me, and this I would do till I was acquainted with
                     all the stars in the heavens’”. <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> applauds the project but points out that paper is flat, whereas the sky, as <span class="persName">Tommy</span> says, “‘seems to rise from the earth on every side like the dome of a great church’”.
                     “‘Then if you were to have some round body’”, <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> suggests, “‘I should think it would correspond to the different parts of the sky,
                     and you might place your stars with more exactness’”. The tutor accordingly supplies
                     <span class="persName">Tommy</span> with a paper‐covered ball, enabling him to devise his own celestial globe based on
                     his own observations of the constellations, remarking both the constellationsʼ relative
                     positions and their nightly movements in the sky. Starting by drawing his “favourite
                     constellation of <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>”, <span class="persName">Tommy</span> next marks the constellation situated on the opposite side of the Pole‐star, which
                     <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> identifies as <span class="name">Cassiopeia</span>; and then he is captured by the “grandeur and beauty” of the “glorious constellation”
                     <span class="name">Orion</span>, which “he could not help observing . . . by intervals, all the evening” as “it seemed
                     to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 164–65, 187–88). Is <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, his version of putting the constellations on paper, albeit on flat paper?</p>
                  <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> begins his poem with <span class="persName">Tommy</span>ʼs admiration of the “grandeur and beauty” of <span class="name">Orion</span> rather than with the practical lesson initiated by <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs tutors, who advise first finding <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>, then tracing its pointer stars to the <span class="name">Pole Star</span>, thereby enabling one to locate the other northern circumpolar constellations in
                     relation to the Wain (i.e., <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, the Great Bear). As <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> explains, “by remembering these stars” that form <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>, one can “very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names
                     too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 163; see also <span class="persName">Joyce</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, 2:16–19). This is the practical recommendation by <span class="persName">Harry Sandford</span>, the farmerʼs boy, for how to find oneʼs way when lost on a dark night. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, in lines 7–11, does name a cluster of circumpolar constellations, starting with
                     <span class="name">Ursa Major</span> and <span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span>. First, however, he predicates his sequence on beauty rather than pragmatism, by
                     beginning the poem with “stars” traditionally regarded as the most beautiful—<span class="name">Venus</span>, the so‐called Morning Star and Evening Star, “Glittering in the evening air”, a
                     wandering rather than a fixed star; and “beside it”, <span class="name">Orionʼs Belt</span>, “a glorious sight for all sky loving men”. Even for <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs drier <span class="persName">Tutor</span>, <span class="name">Venus</span> is “by far the most beautiful of . . . all” planets, prompting a quotation from <span class="persName">Milton</span> praising the Evening and Morning Star; and for <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>, “<span class="name">Orion</span>, which rose every night and glittered in the south”, entices his continuing star‐gazing,
                     perhaps also supplying <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> with his rhapsodic modifier (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span></a>, 2:198; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">History of Sandford and Merton</span></span></a>, 199). From this glittering horizon, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem leads the eye aloft along the ecliptic to <span class="name">Mars</span>, “high / On his throne” and thence to the circumpolar “greater bear” with “<span class="name">charlesʼs wain</span>”.</p>
                  <p>Beyond initially declaring the constellations “a glorious sight” as opposed to a utilitarian
                     compass, does the poem go on to form a coherent graphic translation of the sky? If,
                     as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs belated note in <span class="titlem">MS III</span> admits, the poemʼs sequence of constellation names are “not next in the sky”—that
                     is, if the poem does not in a systematic manner, as <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span> “‘entreat[s]’”, perform the functionally pedagogical purpose of “‘plac[ing] the marks
                     just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and . . . writ[ing] the names for me, .
                     . . till I was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens’”—then what pattern, if
                     any, is formed by situating the constellations “next in this poetry”? Does the ordering
                     of the constellations in the poem reveal an aesthetic, if not a practical aim?</p>
                  <p>While the poemʼs repeated “next” seems to line up the constellation names without
                     a plan, the sequence of naming can be interpreted as the equivalent of <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>ʼs paper globe—that is, the constellation names inscribe a formal pattern on a star
                     map that reads as a spherical shape plotted on a flat plane. As mentioned at the start
                     of this Discussion, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> did own a celestial globe. Print sources were also available to him that contained
                     examples of planispheres, such as <span class="persName">Jamieson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Stereographic Projection of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere on the Plane of the
                        Equinoctial” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Atlas</span></span></a>, pl. 1)</span>. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem can be read as reversing <span class="persName">Mr. Barlow</span>ʼs suggestion, by flattening a celestial globe or dome of the sky on paper in the
                     manner of a “stereographic projection”. The eye of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs speaker inscribes a series of arcs, first by anchoring a “glorious sight”: “there”
                     is <span class="name">Venus</span> “in the evening air”, with <span class="name">Orion</span> “beside it”. Then, having anchored <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Orion</span> on a horizontal plane, the speaker raises the eye “high” to <span class="name">Mars</span>, thus forming an arc. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> anchors an on the horizon and inscribes a spatial arc upward in the sky. As the poem
                     goes on to name the constellations, a spatial pattern emerges of repeated anchoring
                     and arcing, tracing a verbal planisphere.</p>
                  <p>The sequence begins with the northern circumpolar constellations (lines 7–11), as
                     do the printed scientific dialogues. In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs sources, the dialogues typically identify only a few of these constellations—<span class="name">Charlesʼs Wain</span> inside of <span class="name">Ursa Major</span>, its pointer stars leading the eye to the <span class="name">Pole Star</span>, which forms the tip of <span class="name">Ursa Minor</span>ʼs tail. In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poem, the circumpolar constellations serve repeatedly as an anchor to which the
                     sequence returns at fairly regular intervals: <span class="name">Cor Caroli</span> (Charlesʼs Heart, line 13), <span class="name">Ursa Minor</span> (Little Bear, line 18), <span class="name">Cepheus</span> and <span class="name">Bootes</span> (line 27), <span class="name">Lynx</span> (line 30), and <span class="name">Cameleopardalis</span> (line 33). In between these returns to the center, the poem arcs outward by naming
                     constellations on the periphery of the planisphere. This oscillating pattern begins
                     by naming <span class="name">Cygnus</span> (the Swan, line 12), which, viewed from <span class="placeName">London</span>, skirts the north‐northeast horizon (i.e., at 9:00 P.M. in the evening, to adopt
                     <span class="persName">Aspin</span>ʼs standard, and choosing the <span class="date">first quarter of 1828</span> for observation). From <span class="name">Cygnus</span>, the poemʼs next‐named constellation (<span class="name">Cor Caroli</span>) returns the viewer to the center, only to be directed back to the periphery with
                     <span class="name">Caput Medusae</span> (Medusaʼs Head, line 14, as originally drafted and fair‐copied), which lies on the
                     north‐northwest horizon. This time, before returning to the center, the next named
                     constellation circles the viewer back to the northeast horizon near <span class="name">Cygnus</span>, by calling out <span class="name">Equuleus</span> (Little Horse), <span class="name">Anser</span> (Goose), and <span class="name">Lyra</span> (Lyre) (lines 15–17). Then back to the center (<span class="name">Ursa Minor</span>), only to rebound to the <span class="name">Cygnus</span> group in the northeast by naming <span class="name">Vulpecula</span> (the Fox, line 19; see plates 14–15 of <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span></span>, which picture all these constellations). The pattern is comparable to placing oneʼs
                     thumb on the polar north of a celestial globe, or on the center‐point of a planisphere
                     map of the northern hemisphere, and extending oneʼs fingers first toward the quadrant
                     containing <span class="name">Cygnus</span>, and then rotating toward the quadrant containing <span class="name">Perseus et Caput Medusae</span>, and then back again.</p>
                  <p>Having established this sideways rotation, at line 20 the poem plunges into the southern
                     hemisphere, casting a meridian arc from North Pole to South Pole. Thus, a circle becomes
                     a sphere. Naming the “blessed cross”, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> forms a latitudinal vector that can point simultaneously north and south, since the
                     name <span style="font-style:italic">cross</span> can refer either to <span class="name">Cygnus</span>, which is also known as the Northern Cross, or to <span class="name">Crux</span>, the Southern Cross. To confirm the southern direction, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> next names <span class="name">Robur Carolinum</span> (Charlesʼs Oak, line 21), which is nearly adjacent to <span class="name">Crux</span>. Then, sending a latitudinal line back up the sphere, the sequence passes through
                     <span class="name">Crater</span> (the Cup, line 22)—a southern constellation that, unlike <span class="name">Crux</span> and <span class="name">Robur Carolinum</span>, lies far enough north to be visible from <span class="placeName">London</span> on the southwest horizon. Continuing north, the poem lands on <span class="name">Hercules</span> and <span class="name">Cerberus</span> (lines 23–24), near the northern pole. Having inscribed this latitudinal circle,
                     the poem returns to the longitudinal circle by again naming constellations in the
                     <span class="name">Cygnus</span> group—<span class="name">Lacerta</span> (the Lizard, line 25), and <span class="name">Aquila</span> (the Eagle, line 26). Finally, the poem regains the northern pole by naming <span class="name">Cepheus</span>, the King, and <span class="name">Bootes</span>, the Huntsman, (line 27), constellations that are balanced on nearly opposite sides
                     of the pole. And then the poem loops to the South Pole again, naming <span class="name">Apus</span> (Bird of Paradise, line 28, Anglicized as the English “Hirundo” or Swallow, in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs translation).</p>

                  <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> makes a point of naming constellations with British associations, including <span class="name">Telescopium Herschelii (<span class="persName">Herschel</span>ʼs Telescope)</span> and the Carolingian constellations, <span class="name">Cor Caroli (Charlesʼs Heart)</span> and <span class="name">Rober Carolinum (Charlesʼs Oak)</span>—the latter requiring a plunge into southern constellations invisible to British viewers.
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also lends an English inflection to constellation names where possible: for example,
                     <span class="name">Apus</span> is not the tropical Bird of Paradise but the northern Swallow; <span class="name">Leo</span> is not the fierce <span class="name">Nemean Lion</span> but the “generous” and therefore, one supposes, British kingly beast (see the contextual
                     glosses for these constellations; see also <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>).</p>
                  <p>British pride in the nationʼs standing in astronomy was aroused by competition with
                     the French. The French astronomer, <span class="persName">Nicolas‐Louis de Lacaille</span> (<span class="date">1713–62</span>), who mapped the stars in the southern hemisphere from the vantage of the <span class="placeName">Cape of Good Hope</span> in <span class="placeName">south Africa</span>, took aim at <span class="placeName">Robur Carolinum</span>, which honored <span class="persName">Charles II</span> of <span class="placeName">England</span>. As <span class="persName">Lacaille</span> created numerous new constellations of his own in the southern hemisphere, he eliminated
                     the British honorific constellation, criticizing its inventor, the English astronomer
                     <span class="persName">Edmond Halley</span> (<span class="date">1656–1742</span>), for an illogical redistribution of stars originally belonging to the ancient southern
                     constellation, <span class="name">Argo Navis</span> (the Ship of the <span class="orgName">Argonauts</span>). Restoring <span class="name">Robur</span>ʼs stars to the shipʼs prow, <span class="persName">Lacaille</span> justified uprooting <span class="name">Robur</span> on ostensibly scientific grounds, given that new constellations typically were formed
                     from “unformed” stars—that is, stars ignored by <span class="persName">Ptolemy</span> in plotting the ancient constellations—rather than by robbing old constellations
                     of their stars for new configurations. In designing his own new constellations, <span class="persName">Lacaille</span> was inspired by an Enlightenment principle of honoring the modern arts and sciences
                     rather than paying tribute to individual monarchs. Historians suspect <span class="persName">Lacaille</span>, however, of a prejudicial view when targeting specifically a British honorific constellation,
                     while inconsistently retaining constellations that paid tribute to other nationsʼ
                     rulers (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><span class="persName">Barentine</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lost Constellations</span></span></a>, 352–54). The rivalry persisted in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs time, when an <span class="date">1820s</span> British astronomy manual bitterly mocked an attempt to rename a portion of the constellation
                     <span class="name">Orion</span> after <span class="persName">Napoleon</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="persName">Aspin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span> (2d ed., <span class="date">1825</span>)</a>, 147; see <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#ORIONGLOSS"><span class="name">Orion</span>, contextual gloss</a>).</p>
                  <p>Another rivalry between British and French popular science, while not directly related
                     to astronomy, was in the news when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was composing <span class="titlem">“The Constellations“</span> and may have animated his choice to name the constellation <span class="name">Camelopardalis (the Giraffe)</span>, although he assigns it no contextualizing epithet. In <span class="date">1827–28</span>, the first living specimen of a giraffe was imported to <span class="placeName">Britain</span>, an event that spurred competition with <span class="placeName">France</span>, which also received a specimen (see <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#CAMELOPARDALISGLOSS"><span class="name">Camelopardalis</span>, contextual gloss</a>). What appears a preference for constellations representing animals, birds, and fabulous
                     beasts among <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs choices may have been prompted by the opening of the <span class="placeName">London Zoo</span> in <span class="date">March 1828</span>.</p>

                     In this peroration, Ruskin struck out "history" and substituted "knowledge", thus
                     extending the sway of "virtue" over a potentially broader scope of ways of knowing.
                     Objectionable knowledge in this poem took two forms, as suggested by the lines that
                     his mother flagged for revision and Ruskin's consequent revisions: evocations of horror
                     or violence, and examples of paganism that approached blasphemy from a Christian perspective
                     (see <a class="link_ref" href="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR">Margaret Ruskinʼs Role in the Fair‐Copying Process</a>).</p>
                  <p>In the print sources on astronomy available to Ruskin in the 1820s, the problem of
                     reconciling astronomical knowledge--scientific or "historical" (i.e., mytholological
                     and pre-Christian)--adopted a range of approaches. In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</span></span>, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> cannot avoid the pagan, mythical names of the constellations, but she avoids alluding
                     to the myths themselves, defining the constellations neutrally as “remarkable groups
                     or clusters of stars, to which names of various figures have been given”. She does
                     not pursue the identity of the figures or their stories, presumably fearing that a
                     fascination with the myths approaches idolatry, as suggested by a quotation she delivers
                     from <span class="titlem">Chronicles</span>: “For great is the <span class="persName">Lord</span>, and greatly to be praised: he also is to be feared above all gods. For all the gods
                     of the people are idols: the Lord made the heavens” (<span class="titlem">1 Chron 16</span>: 25–26). Instead, <span class="persName">Mrs. Sherwood</span> directs admiration of the stars toward Christian praise: “We find in Scripture the
                     glory of the righteous in the resurrection compared to that of the stars; by which
                     comparison we find, that their splendour will partake of that of the Son of God himselfȁ

                     knowledge: “The names and figures are of very ancient date, and are still retained
                     for the sake of distinction, as well as to avoid confusion in comparing ancient with
                     modern observations” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</span></span></a>, 102). This functional justification does not prevent <span class="persName">Aspin</span> from summarizing the “fables” associated with each of the constellations—summaries
                     keyed to the cards depicting the mythical figures, which are collected in <span class="name"><span style="font-style:italic">Uraniaʼs Mirror</span></span>. <span class="persName">Aspin</span> reconciles the pagan tales with Christian revelaton by occasionally interpreting
                     the mythical figures as biblical types (in the contextual glosses on the poem, see
                     Aspin's commentary, e.g., on <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#ORIONGLOSS"><span class="name">Orion</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#DRACOGLOSS"><span class="name">Draco</span></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#PEGASUSGLOSS"><span class="name">Pegasus</span></a>).</p>
                  <p>Jacob Green, Aspin's American competitor for the market in illustrated guides to the
                     mythology of the constellations, and Alexander Jamieson, whose illustrations in the
                     Celestial Atlas were plagiarized by the artists for both Green's Astronomical Recreations
                     and for Urania's Mirror, were given to jousting with more specific theological controversies
                     surrounding astronomical lore. Green fumed, for example, over the controversy surrounding
                     the Zodiac of Dendera--an Egyptian stone antiquity representating the zodiac, which
                     was purloined by French agents during the Napoleonic era and believed by some savants
                     to predate the generations of Noah by thousands of years. Contradicting the biblical
                     narrative, the Zodiac of Dendera appeared to present an alignment of equinoxes with
                     constellations that the artifact's creators could have witnessed only in an ancient
                     sky from long before the Flood, as proven by calculations based on the precession
                     of the earth's poles. This controversy, which provoked a surprising investment of
                     scientific, philologial, theological, and political attention (see Buchwald and Josefowicz,
                     The Zodiac of Paris), was countered dismissively by Green with an appeal to the popular
                     theological lectures of Thomas Chalmers (see the contextual gloss on <a class="link_ref" href="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#LEOGLOSS"><span class="name">Leo (the Lion)</span></a>). While Green's appeal is complacent and reactionary, Chalmers's blending of natural
                     theology and Scottish evangelicalism probably reflected the standing of Ruskin's parents
                     on questions of conflict between science and biblical authority. The family library

                     sacred, Ruskin is unequal to the third approach--an engagement with the varieties
                     of natural theology, which attempt a dialogue between science and faith--but he combines
                     the other two approaches in the conclusion to "The Constellations". First, in his
                     declaration that "history" or "knowledge" is less "bright" than "virtue", he effectively
                     adopts Mrs. Sherwood's strategy of bluntly subordinating astronomical facts to Bible
                     quotations. Comparing their treatments of the planet Mercury, which Ruskin likens
                     to virtue, one finds Mrs. Sherwood's information about that planet dominated by a
                     quotation from Acts. Paul and Barnabas, while preaching in the Roman colony of Lycaonia,
                     are horrified to be confused by their audience with pagan gods, Mercury (Hermes) and
                     Jupiter (Zeus). Amazed that Paul successfully commanded a cripple to walk, the Lycaonians
                     "lifted up their voices, saying . . . 'The gods have come down to us in the likeness
                     of men!'". The point of the episode is to condemn as idolatrous any knowledge other
                     than the apostles' witness. In Mrs. Sherwood's transcription:</p>

                           <p>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker.
                              Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands
                              unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people. Which when the apostles,
                              Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people,
                              crying out, and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions
                              with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living
                              God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein.</p>

                  <p>In the exercise that Mrs. Sherwood recommends for the use of her book, the child reader
                     is expected to memorize and recite this passage of scripture along with a few facts
                     about the planet (see <a class="link_ref" href="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</a>). No application of the scripture is invited or necessary, since the message is flattened
                     to the solitary implication that any learning is idolatrous that fails to lead to
                     praise of the Creator.</p>
                  <p>Ruskin's comparison of "beauteous" Mercury with virtue entails an additional level
                     of interpretation, however, since his choice of Mercury implies a typological reading
                     based on knowledge that Mrs. Sherwood prohibits--the myths of Hermes. Even the story
                     from Acts requires such knowledge to explain why the Lycaonians believed Paul to be
                     Hermes, given that "he was the chief speaker". Ruskin may have found an explanation
                     in a reference work on Greek and Roman mythology known to have existed in the family
                     library, and probably acquired in the 1820s when he composed "The Constellations":
                     The Pantheon: Or, Ancient History of the Gods of Greece and Rome, by Edward Baldwin,
                     a pseudonym of William Godwin (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 21 [no. 136]; and for dating, see <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#UNTRACED">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Untraced Books—<span class="persName">Baldwin [pseud.

Here, Ruskin would have found pleasure in the attributes of the god of eloquence:</p>

                           <p>[Mercury] "is said to be the inventor of letters; and his Greek name, Hermes, is derived
                              from a word in that language which signifies "to interpret" or "explain": in this
                              quality Mercury is the God of eloquence, as Apollo is the God of poetry: an ingenious
                              writer of the present age (John Horne Tooke, in his Diversions of Purley) has considered
                              the wings which this God annexes to his feet, as emblematical of the wings which language
                              gives to the thoughts of men.</p>
                           <p>(Baldwin [pseud. Godwin], The Pantheon, 58)</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>While this extended gloss identifies Mercury with oratory, Ruskin's more surprising
                     association of the deity with virtue requires examining the effects of eloquence.
                     To make this case, The Pantheon is a compelling source, since Godwin disassociates
                     Mercury from the evil uses of rhetoric, just as he exonerates the god from dishonest
                     uses of buying and selling, in his role as "inventor of traffic, . . . said to have
                     introduced the use of weights, measures, and contracts". In an exception that John
                     James Ruskin would perhaps have appreciated, Godwin argues that "licentiousness" in
                     the "Greek imagination" led them to have "indecorously represented Mercury as the
                     God of thieves", since a failing lies in human nature and in the system of traffic
                     itself, which is "too apt to degenerate into a system of fraud": "[W]hen men engage
                     in buying and selling and barter as a profession, the more keen and grasping among
                     them will endeavour to buy cheap and sell dear, and cozen and overreach those with
                     whom they have any dealings" (Baldwin [pseud. Godwin], The Pantheon, 58).</p>
                  <p>Thus, whereas Mrs. Sherwood's exercise sets up a hierarchy of whole categories of
                     knowledge, Godwin's approach undertakes to educate the child reader's own imagination,
                     which he engages by humanizing the sacred: "There are many things related of this
                     God, which forcibly suggest to us the idea of a man, who for his great and essential
                     services to his fellow-beings, was worshipped as a divinity after his death". Mercury
                     wields magical powers by virtue of his <span style="font-style:italic">caduceus</span>--the winged wand coiled by two serpents, which he carries--but the magic resides
                     less in this instrument itself than in its uses, its "sovereign power in appeasing
                     quarrels and controversies":</p>

                              to regard each other with eyes of affection: one of the earliest experiments that
                              was made of it in this respect, happened thus: two serpents were fighting with terrible
                              fierceness; their eyes flashed fire, their hissings were infernal, it seemed as if
                              the combat could end in nothing less than the destruction of both: Mercury, happening
                              to come by, touched them with his wand; they were immediately at peace; they embraced
                              each other; they wreathed themselves round the instrument of their reconciliation,
                              and remained ever after the ornament of the caduceus of the God.</p>

                  <p>This direction of the imagination toward fellow-feeling characterizes Margaret Ruskin's

                     for revision, Ruskin substituted epithets, which reference stories of mutual help

                        in astronomy. As a distinct activity from professional astronomy with its mathematical
                        orientation combined with observation—the less popularly accessible approach, which
                        <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Tutor</span> encourages over the mythological tradition—there thrived in the <span class="date">1820s</span> a popular form of astronomy education, which combined technology with art, modern
                        science with traditional elements such as the <span class="name">Zodiac</span>. The popular astronomy lecture was a theatrical entertainment, commonly known as
                        Lenten astronomy lectures since they could be held in <span class="placeName">London</span> theaters during the holy season, when plays were forbidden. The timing of these spectacles
                        fits with the proposed <span class="date">April–June 1828</span> period for composition of <span class="titlem">“The Constellations”</span>, which might have been initiated by attendance at a lecture. (In <span class="date">1828</span>, Easter Day fell on <span class="date">6 April</span>. <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs accounts for <span class="date">April 1828</span> include “Abernethys Lect<sup>rs</sup>” for 12<span style="font-style:italic">s</span>, but this entry probably refers to published lectures by the surgeon, <span class="persName">John Abernethy</span> [<span class="date">1764–1831</span>]; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a>, 6r).</p>
                     <p>The astronomy lecture circuit—originating in the <span class="date">late eighteenth century</span>, becoming a craze in the <span class="date">1820s</span>, and remaining a staple of popular science instruction at least until <span class="date">mid—century</span>—has been researched by <span class="persName">Hsiang—Fu Huang</span>, who finds that its performative and entrepreneurial aspects overlapped with the
                        insitutional framework of lecturing that was supposedly displacing these popular forms
                        of instruction in the <span class="date">1820s</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGSHAREDARENA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“A Shared Arena”</span></a>).

                     <p>Even as educational entertainments for children, however, the Lenten astronomy lectures
                        were regarded with some criticism by educators, as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> would have known from <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank</span></span>. After <span class="persName">Frank</span> has attempted and failed on his own to construct an <span style="font-style:italic">orrery</span>, a model of the solar system, his parents take him and his cousin <span class="persName">Mary</span> to an astronomy lecture at a theater. The performance features something like the
                        large—scale, illuminated or “transparent” stage orreries with Greek—inspired names
                        like <span style="font-style:italic">Eidouranion</span>, which combined the older mechanical, three—dimensional orrery that reproduced the
                        revolutions of the sun and planets with transparancies projected by a magic lantern
                        (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 49–51, 66 n. 23). For <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, criticism of these spectacles pertains not just to quack lecturers and creaky, dysfunctional
                        orreries, which <span class="persName">Huang</span> finds in satires of the day (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 62–63); more fundamentally, <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> points to conflicts with reformersʼ principles of effective pedagogy.</p>
                     <p>The theatrical spectacle is a grand but passive presentation, discouraging learning
                        through experience and self—discovery. Even though <span class="persName">Frank</span> had failed to complete his own orrery because he over—reached his abilities, the
                        stage orrery is “particularly interesting to <span class="persName">Frank</span>” thanks only to “the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made, to
                        understand and to represent” the revolving bodies. The other “little children” in
                        the audience went “dead asleep” and “even he”, <span class="persName">Frank</span>, “after all his reading in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, had much difficulty sometimes in understanding both the machine and the lecturer”.
                        <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age—appropriate
                        accessibility of young listeners. The lecturer overwhelms the audience “with a vast
                        number of words, which” <span class="persName">Frank</span> “strained his attention” to understand, trusting that the lengthy explanations “were

                        it is the sight of the real moon on the ride home that prompts a spontaneous reaction
                        from <span class="persName">Mary</span>: “‘How beautiful!’ said she: ‘and how—’ sublime! she would have said, but she did
                        not know the word well enough: she knew the feeling.” <span style="font-style:italic">Feelings</span> are represented as accessible, regardless of age and learning; and despite <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs promotion of the Industrial Sublime in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>, here <span class="persName">Frank</span> responds to <span class="persName">Mary</span>ʼs admiration: “How wonderful! What is the orrery compared to this, <span class="persName">Mary</span>! . . . How grand! how different from any thing that the most ingenious man in this
                        world can make!” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, 2:251, 253, 255, 249, 256, 257).</p>
                     <p>The opposite effect on children was promised by promoters of astronomy as a theatrical
                        spectacle: astronomical science in particular, it was argued, benefits by the intervention
                        of art. According to the <span class="date">1826</span> guidebook, astronomy lectures are the epitome science enhanced of metropolitan “improvements

                                 which admit of popular illustration, is doubly valuable for its powerful influence
                                 and effect in the general improvement of the human mind. . . . {T}he science of astronomy
                                 is . . . the very science of which a popular display may most successfully be aided
                                 by the ornamental arts. Music, painting, sculpture, may be called in as auxiliaries,
                                 with powerful effect, and manifest benefit; a tasteful introduction of poetry may
                                 be deemed almost essential to success; and we would undertake that Urania need not
                                 disdain the co—operation of Terpsichore herself.</p>

                     <p><span class="persName">Wellbeloved</span> devotes two pages describing in detail how a new “hydraulic” orrery has improved
                        on older “instruments . . . hitherto . . . constructed by a complication of wheel—work,
                        which, although extremely ingenious, are nevertheless almost unequal to the imitation
                        of those equable, silent, and undeviating movements, which characterize the grandest
                        works of the <span class="persName">Creator</span>”. Yet, despite the interest the reader is assumed to take in two close pages of technical
                        description of how hydraulic improvements have brought the orrery closer to the operations
                        of the <span class="persName">Creator</span>, the accompanying engraving sets the machine in a “design of our own”—a moonlit natural
                        landscape like the scene that impresses <span class="persName">Mary</span> and <span class="persName">Frank</span> as tending to the disadvantage of technology (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WELLBELOVEDLONDONLIONS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">London Lions for Country Cousins and Friends about Town</span></span></a>, 6–7).</p>

                        <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs fictional treatment, the topics resemble those listed in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WALKEREPITOME"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">An Epitome of Astronomy . . . as Illustrated by the Eidouranion</span></span></a>, a pamphlet published to accompany lectures by the Walker family, first published

                                 which neither <span class="persName">Mary</span> nor <span class="persName">Frank</span> could comprehend. His father judiciously and kindly took them out to rest their attention,
                                 and refresh themselves while this lasted. They went into a cool room, where they eat
                                 oranges and biscuits, and drank lemonade, till the tides were over” (2:252).</li>
                           </ul>

                        <li class="item"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Last Scene</span></span>. This final scene is not announced in the pamphlet by a separate heading, as is the
                           case with the four preceding scenes, but embedded in a peroration on the infinitude
                           of the universe: “. . . how in adequate must the utmost stretch of finite faculties
                           be to represent infinity! The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by
                           concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little: The attempt in the
                           <span class="titlem">LAST SCENE</span>, if not admired, we hope will be forgiven. But was it possible we could actually
                           take our flight into infinite space, or be borne on the wings of lightning, to the
                           most distant fixed Star we can now see, even there, perhaps we should find ourselves
                           on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! For
                           space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where,
                           but whose circumference is no where!” (pp. 36–37).</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>According to this description, the <span class="titlem">“Last Scene”</span>, at least as delivered by the Walker family, which by <span class="date">1828</span> had passed into the management of <span class="persName">Deane Franklin Walker</span> (<span class="date">1778–1865</span> [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HUANGURANIA"><span class="persName">Huang</span>, <span class="titlem">“When Urania Meets Terpsichore”</span></a>, 50]), the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale.
                        Could <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> have conceived of his poem as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene?
                        Apparently, in this show, a transparency exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded
                        by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. In an engraving by <span class="persName">I. Stow</span> (ca. <span class="date">1770–1823</span>), after <span class="persName">E. F. Burney</span> (<span class="date">1760–1848</span>), <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The proscenium of the English Opera House in the <span class="placeName">Strand</span>, (Late Lyceum.) as it appeared on the Evening of the <span class="date">21st March 1817</span>, with Walkerʼs Exhibition of the Eidouranion</span></span>, published by <span class="persName">Robert Wilkinson</span>, Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience,
                        enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring,
                        which showed the <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations. The <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. Perhaps
                        the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in
                        their mythological guise, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in his way has reproduced.</p>
                     <p>The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkersʼ
                        exhibition—or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4—with the rising and setting
                        of <span class="name">Venus</span> and <span class="name">Mars</span>. As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <span class="persName">Day</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations
                        in the sky. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The <span class="name">Zodiac</span> constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. The most significant point
                        to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs catalogue may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</p>
