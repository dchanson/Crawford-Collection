                            it seems likely that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had devoted the latter part of this period&#x2014;perhaps, 
                            <date notBefore="1826-12-01" notAfter="1827-01-01">December through January</date>&#x2014;to fair&#x2010;copying and/or composing the poetry anthology, 
                            while he had spent <date notBefore="1826-09-01" notAfter="1826-11-30">the fall of 1826</date> on <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title> 
                            (see also <ref type="apparatus" target="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="#THENEEDLESSALARM">&#x201C;The Needless Alarm&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref>;

                            It is also possible that, as suggested by a change in narrative style midway in the text of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have drafted the opening portion at an earlier period (see <ref type="internal" target="#SOURCES">Discussion: Sources</ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>According to the narrative of Volume 1, while <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> 
                            are visiting the seaside resort of <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName>, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> 
                            identifies the fourth day of their visit as &#x201C;the longest day&#x201D;, a remark that <persName corresp="#HGV">Helen Gill Viljoen</persName> interpreted 
                            as referring to the summer solstice (which fell on <date when="1826-06-21">June 21 in 1826</date> and on <date when="1827-06-21">June 22 in 1827</date>). 
                            <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> infers that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition date for Volume 1 must therefore be extended well past 
                            the terminus a quo of <date when="1827-01">January 1827</date> established by <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss on 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> to some time after <date when="1827-06">June 1827</date> 
                            (&#x201C;Dating MSS. of Boyhood&#x201D;, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliograph.php#VILJOENPAPERS"><title type="archive" corresp="#VILJOENPAPERS">Viljoen Papers</title></ref>, boxes D.V, E.IX).</p>
                        
                        <p><persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> discounted the possibility that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName>&#x02BC;s remark 
                            refers to a holiday that, in real life, had already occurred, in <date when="1826-06">June 1826</date>, 
                            before <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> started work on <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref> 
                            according to <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s gloss. 
                            She rejected this interpretation presumably on the grounds that the family could not have holidayed at the seaside in <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> 
                            during <date when="1826-06">June 1826</date>, if they had already departed for

                            shortly after <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s birthday on <date when="1826-05-10">May 10</date>. 
                            (<persName corresp="#WGC">W. G. Collingwood</persName>, not having noticed the clue about a &#x201C;longest day&#x201D;, assumed that the holiday must have preceded <date when="1826-05-10">May 10</date> 
                            and occurred in &#x201C;the spring of 1826&#x201d; [<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#WGCLIFEOFJR1893"><hi rend="italic">The Life and Work of John Ruskin</hi> [1893]</title></ref>, 1:25;

                            It is now known, however, that the family must have delayed a vacation that year, since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> 
                            traveled for customer orders well past his birthday (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php">Tours of 1826&#x2013;27</ref>). 
                            It is thus more plausible that, insofar as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drew on actual events that occurred at <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> 
                            to help form his tale, he referred to a trip in the few months prior to when <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> notes that he began work on 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>. 
                            <!--DCH ERRONEOUS REFERENCE? In fact, in chapter 1, in which Harry and Lucy are still situated at home, prior to the journey described in chapter 8, Lucy mentions an event

                            with the characters&#x02BC; fictional time. (Of course, it is possible, too, that the narrative refers to <hi rend="italic">two</hi> seaside holidays, 
                            with Lucy&#x02BC;s comment in chapter 1 hearkening back to a <date notBefore="1825-06-21" notAfter="1825-09-22">summer 1825</date> journey, 
                            and Harry&#x02BC;s narration in chapter 8 reflecting events in <date when="1826-06">June 1826</date>. What seems least warranted by the evidence 
                            is that <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s date for the completion of

                            <p>Composition may have entailed two distinct stages of draft. While the four or five months comprised by <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02bc;s dating of MS I 
                                could account for fair&#x2010;copying and perhaps some simultaneous drafting of

                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#DATEOFCOMPOSITIONVOL1">Date of Composition: Volume 1</ref>), internal evidence suggests that chapter 1 of the prose narrative 
                            may be based on a distinctly earlier stage of composition. At the start of chapter 2, the narrative exhibits an abrupt shift 
                            from direct dialogue to third&#x2010;person narration. For the first time, a narrator addresses the reader, and the dialogue carries such tags as 
                            &#x201C;said her <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMA">mother</persName>&#x201D; and &#x201C;answered her <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PAPA">father</persName>&#x201D;. 
                            The shift in narrative method is accompanied by new characters appearing on the scene. In chapter 1, 
                            the dialogue is limited to <persName type="fictional" corresp="LUCY">Lucy</persName> and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMA">mother</persName>, whereas <persName type="fictional" corresp="PAPA">Papa</persName> is said to be away from home in the City.
                                In chapter 2, <persName type="fictional" corresp="PAPA">Papa</persName> comes home, has a brief exchange with <persName type="fictional" corresp="LUCY">Lucy</persName>, and then, as the narrator informs us, 
                                &#x201C;<persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> has gone to bed

                                The sources behind subsequent exchanges&#x2014;which tend to be three&#x2010;way between <persName type="fictional" corresp="PAPA">Papa</persName>, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">harry</persName>, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName>, excluding <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MAMMA">Mama</persName>&#x2014;are

                            whereas possible adaptations from these texts in chapter 1 are less certain. A likelier inspiration for chapter 1 may be the dialogues 
                            in <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="barbauld_anna_laetitia_note.php">Laetitia Barbauld</ref>'s Evenings at Home. 
                            <!--PICK UP HERE MSF Barbauld's simple stories and dialogues were recommended for children younger than the intended audience of Edgeworth's concluding sequels 
                            to the Early Lessons series. One can imagine, therefore, that Ruskin may have drafted a version of the dialogues included in chapter 1 at a stage 
                            before he had even read Edgeworth's sophisticated tales, which were advanced for him even at age seven to eight

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCY">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy Concluded&#x201D;</title> is a composite work in two senses: 
                            from the start, he parsed the project into volumes, although the three existing volumes seem discontinuous from one another; 
                            and he treated the idea of a <hi rend="italic">volume</hi> as a composite in itself, capable of expanding beyond the Edgeworthian lesson in the form of dialogue to include other genres--poetry, 
                            emblem, travelogue--as well as paratextual features such as illustration. In compounding of texts to form a volume, Ruskin was not prompted simply by an impulse of accretion, 
                            but making an observation about the tendency of Edgeworth's instructional works for children to nod approvingly at other works of its kind. In Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy Concluded, 
                            the characters consult books that their readers can acquire and read for themselves, as Ruskin certainly did--Scientific Dialogues by Jeremiah Joyce, the Poems of Darwin, Conversations on Chemistry by ????. 
                            As a particularly witty example, Ruskin may have formed the poetry anthology appended to volume 1 of his Harry and Lucy Concluded 
                            by fulfilling what exists in Edgeworth's text as a frustrated digression--a digression into Erasmus Darwin both as a text and as a location, 
                            as Harry's desire to visit Birmingham is denied, and Darwin's poem on the steam engine is broken off with a quotation. In Ruskin's volume, 
                            he develops his own version of the poem, and places it at the head an anthology.</p>
                        <p>in According to the <ref type="witness" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_msi.php#TITLEPAGE">title page of volume 1</ref>, 
                            the illustrations were not an afterthought, at least at the fair-copying stage: "printed and composed by a little boy &#x007C; and also drawn", 
                            volume 1 promises "copper plates", as does the <ref type="witness" target="harry_and_lucy_vol2_msiii.php#TITLEPAGE">title page of volume 2</ref>. 
                            The indecisive placement of a colophon in volume 1 suggests that a further accretion may have been conceived more belatedly--a collection of verse, 
                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</title></ref>--but 
                            the calculated placement of the anthology, <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                            in volume 2, allowing sufficient space for the ocmpletion of "Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2", indicates that this feature had become standard.</p>
                        
                        <p>Like a later work, Account of a Tour on the Continent, Ruskin's Harry and Lucy both takes its cue of comnposite genres from its model and elaborates the possibilites. 
                            In the Account, Ruskin tops Samuel Rogers's illustrated tour poem, Italy, by pairing the topographical poems with prose travelogues, and he enhances the prose pieces with their own graphic vignettes, 
                            doubling the expected complement of illustrations to be found in Rogers. Maria Edgeworth's Harry and Lucy Concluded was published without any illustrations at all; 
                            and while the book does quote snatches of verse, its four volumes lace a complete poem, much less an anthology.
                            
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended a volume to comprise not only a division of a lengthier prose work, 
                            but also illustration. Unlike Maria Edgeworth's original four-volume work, Ruskin's is illustrated, the title page declaring 
                            Volume 1 comes to include, moreover, 
                            and while Ruskin may or may not originally have stretched his idea a volume of lessons in dialogue form to comprise a verse anthology, 
                            the indecisive treatment of a colophon at the end of this Red Book suggests that the generic and material boundaries had sprung wide open

                            would include a poetry anthology, evidence is strong that he started Volume 2 on this plan, by estimating the number of leaves he would require for the second installment of "Harry and Lucy Concluded" 
                            to close with , 
                            which he composed roughly simultaneously with the prose work. 
                            When he failed to compose sufficient "Harry and Lucy" material to fill the intervening leaves, 
                            he substituted another anthology, "Poetry" [MS III Second Poetry Anthology] 
                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>: Discussion</ref>). 
                            The title page for Volume 2 of "Harry and Lucy Concluded" is uniform with that 
                            for Volume 1, likewise promising "copper plates"; and while this title page, like the first, mentions nothing about poetry, its placement in the Red Book--filling 
                            the first available blank page, the verso of the front flyleaf--suggests that Ruskin thought of this physical notebook, MS III, as coterminous with "Vol 2."</p>
                        <p>As Ruskin went on to fill MS III with "The Monastery," his incomplete versification of Walter Scott's novel, as well as with the MS III Third Poetry Anthology, 
                            the manuscript came increasingly to attenuate the connections--and therefore foreground the persistent ambiguities--between 
                            <hi rend="italic">work</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manuscript</hi> in the early Ruskin, 
                            a creative tension between text and/or picture and its physical embodiment; between <hi rend="italic">composite work</hi> and <hi rend="italic">anthology</hi>, 
                            a creative tension between an integrated multigenre work and a collection of multiple, more or less thematically related works--each a kind of corpus. As throughout ERM, 
                            the editor can only make a case for the integrity of boundaries that define separate works while drawing attention to what Neil Fraistat would call the contexture 
                            that tempted Ruskin to extend those boundaries. 
                            "Harry and Lucy" is a prose work modeled on the lesson, a prose dialogue form developed by the Romantic educationists to prompt the child learner to ask questions 
                            and actively explore the world rather than to passively accept information and morals. This prose form is declared by Ruskin's title pages for the three volumes 
                            of "Early Lessons"; and by this declaration, he links the three separate "volumes" of prose, composed over three years, 
                            to form a single work, even though the three installments share stronger thematic contextures with their respectively attached poetry anthologies 
                            than with one another.</p>
                        <p>A composite repesents creative and cognitive development. 
                            At this stage of Ruskin's development as a writer, he forms composites by projecting forward linearly--"Vol 1" implying a "Vol 2," 
                            just as in his earliest drawings he tends to line figures up along a horizontal plane, parallel with the axis of the page. As he casts forward into contexture, 
                            however, thematic associations leap hypertextually, just as by the end of MS I his drawings begin to display serpentine lines bending from behind and around other objects. 
                            In "Harry and Lucy," Ruskin forms a composite is through accretion, adding one thing to another, until this method comes to seem unsatisfactory, 
                            and then he stops, leaving the work unfinished, ending mid-sentence after only ? pages of the third volume. Later, in the more sophisticated composite work, 
                            Account, he will develop the work from the inside out, extending a verse travelogue not only by adding one poem to another but also by elaborating each poem 
                            with related drawings and prose descriptions. When that experiment is accomplished sufficiently, Ruskin will stop that work, as well, rather than complete it.

                        <p>As Christine Alexander has commented, in nineteenth-century imaginative accounts of childhood such as the bildungsroman, a child's voice is appropriated by an adult narrator; 
                            however, in nineteenth-century juvenilia, the reverse occurs: a child writer appropriates an adult voice. 
                            Child writers adopted "the freedoms of the adult world" by working "within a defined discourse" that they discovered in the print culture surrounding them. 
                            A typical resource was the nineteenth-century periodical, such as <hi rend="italic">Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, 
                            which supplied the Bront&#x00EB; children with a range of discourses to imitate and adapt. 
                            By this means, child writers gave "an account of both their own and the adult world," and they empowered themselves 
                            to "construct an identity of authorship" chosen in "response to the print culture of their time" 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERPLAYANDAPPRENTICESHIP">Alexander, &#x201C;Play and Apprenticeship&#x201D;</ref>, 31). 
                            For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, the first prose discourse to serve this purpose was the genre of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="lesson_note.php">lesson</ref>, 
                            as developed by <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="edgeworth_maria_note.php"><persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName></ref> and others. 
                            Just as Charlotte and Branwell Bront&#x00EB; traded editorship of their own <hi rend="italic">Young Men&#x02BC;s Magazine</hi>, colonizing the adult discourses found in 
                            <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi>, 
                            so Ruskin honed his powers of authorship by refashioning his surburban world of 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref> as dialogues 
                            between fictional interlocutors borrowed from Edgeworth and Jeremiah Joyce.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, in the material appearance of their manuscripts, the child writers appropriated and adapted the typography of the adult publications to their purposes. 
                            In the case of the Bront&#x00EB;s&#x02BC; <hi rend="italic">Young Men&#x02BC;s Magazine</hi>, "their title pages actually looked like those of 
                            <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s</hi>, set out with elaborate colophons and publication details. 
                            They wrote editorial notes, contents pages, letters to the editor, advertisements, serialised stories, poems, reviews of paintings and books--all 
                            in minuscule script to imitate the print of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s Edinburgh Magazine</hi> 
                            and signed by different fictitious Glass Town characters" 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERREADERSANDWRITERS">Alexander, &#x201C;Readers and Writers&#x201D;</ref>, 60). 
                            Ruskin, too, adhered closely to his adult model by basing his title page directly on 
                            <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HARRYANDLUCYCONCLUDED">Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</hi></ref>; 
                            and while he did not write in a minuscule hand, he imitated typographic features in his print lettering. For example, he troubled to add serifs to many of his letters; 
                            and for many of his capitals, he drew a pillar-like, doubled vertical stroke that he called "double lettering." He also justified the margins of his prose text. 
                            In some places, he simply drew a vertical line to rule the margin nearest the gutter. In other places, he adopted the hyphen as a punctuation device to terminate 
                            a line at the justified right margin. In only approximately a half-dozen of these instances, however, did he employ the hyphen conventionally, 
                            as a sign for word division at the terminus of a line; rather, in the child writer's spirit of adaptation, he used the mark where no word was divided, 
                            but rather as a filler to take up blank space where his printing fell short of the ruled vertical margin. 
                            Despite these exacting contrivances, Ruskin does not imitate his print culture slavishly. He combines elements from varying models, 
                            supplying "plates" for Edgeworth's book, which was not originally illustrated, and he embellishes his version by adding a poetry anthology. 
                            Both on the title page and in the colophon, he adapts his imitations to his own world, in which the work is 
                            &#x201C;composed by a little boy and also drawn,&#x201D; and which is published at 
                            &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#HERNE">hernhill</placeName>&#x201D; in an apparently fictitious &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName>&#x201D;

                        </p>
                        <p>At the same time, the Bront&#x00EB;s&#x02BC; adaptations of adult print culture present contrasts with Ruskin's, contrasts that correspond to differences 
                            between writing exchanged among a group of siblings and writing performed by an only child and presented to his parents. 
                            In Charlotte Bront&#x00EB;&#x02BC; <hi rend="italic">Young Men&#x02BC;s Magazine</hi>, devised as a "Second Series" when she took over editing of the family 
                            magazine from Branwell, and in Branwell's reply to the new series, "The Liar Detected," 
                            the sister and brother competed with one another and ridiculed the other's writing. Their jousting was in keeping with their model, 
                            <hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s</hi> having made its mark with its satirical ribaldry by and between thinly veiled personae in such features as 
                            the "Noctes Ambrosianae." In this series of imaginary conversations, which ran between 1822 and 1835, 
                            and which was authored primarily by John Wilson (1785-1854), barbs were traded between Wilson as "Christopher North," 
                            William Maginn (1794-1842) as "Ensign O'Doherty," 
                            Thomas De Quincey (1785-1859) as the "Opium Eater," and 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="hogg_james_note.php">James Hogg (ca. 1770&#x2013;1835)</ref> as the "Ettrick Shepherd." 
                            Just as these personae vented spleen on one another and on other contemporary writers, while imbibing in "Ambrose Tavern," 
                            Charlotte used her "Conversations" in "Bravey's Inn" to mock Branwell's character, Young Soult, poet of Glass Town, who interrupts the exchange with his frothing verse, 
                            culminating in a fainting fit. Branwell parried in "The Liar Detected" by vilifying "unprincipled wretches who, having no caracter<!-- stet: DCH --> of their own to support 
                            and being too indolent to work, vilely employ their days in spitting their venom on every author of reputation within their reach." Such was Charlotte's 
                            persona, Lord Charles Wellesley, who, having raised himself to literary greatness on the admiration of "ladies of fashion," has now "forsooth" "stuck up a 
                            little magazine to instruct" these "young misses" 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRONTESTALES">Bront&#x00EB;s, <hi rend="italic">Tales of Glass Town, Angria, and Gondal</hi>, ed. Alexander</ref>, 45-47, 317-18). 
                            In this "sibling rivalry which helped to fuel Charlotte's and Branwell's joint efforts," 
                            Carol Bock comments, "<hi rend="italic">Blackwood&#x02BC;s</hi> satiric model of literary production and reception" served as an analogue, 
                            meeting "the personal needs of these two competitive young writers" and validating their rivalry, "by giving [their exchange] expression and cultural authority 
                            at the same time that [the analogue] displaced their competition from the problematic context of family to the safer arena of public life and professional experience"

                        <p>By comparison, in volume 1 of "Harry and Lucy," Ruskin's Harry and Lucy converse in harmonious exchange, presumably because 
                            both characters present uniform extensions of the single self of this solitary child writer. It is only with the arrival at Herne Hill of Ruskin's 
                            cousin, Mary Richardson, that the voices of Ruskin's fictional personae diverge and contest one another.

                            original and based on actual experience (with the exception of the unlikely exchange about silkworms). The dialogue is nonetheless based on the <hi rend="italic">kind</hi> of discourse found in <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s
                            books, such as the passage in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> has the Mamma exploit a task of winding balls of silk thread in order to quiz Lucy on the multiplication
                            tables. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> seems to relate vivid, everyday experiences with his mother, who, one might speculate, tutored her son using the educational techniques
                            advocated in <hi rend="italic">Practical Education</hi>. Thus, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; possibly was
                            art imitating life imitating art. (Servants, however, make no appearance at all, not even <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s nurse, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="strachan_ann_note.php"><persName corresp="#ASB">Ann Strachan</persName></ref>, important as she was to him 
                            (see, e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 109).</p>
                        <p>Personalities and situations in the text seem somewhat modeled on real impressions, as well. The fictional Mamma in &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; is methodical, insistent on
                            &#x201C;do[ing] one thing at once,&#x201D; a character suggestive of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, who tended to spy dangers in any behavior, even opposed behaviors, that failed to be regulated 
                            by &#x201C;principles&#x201D; (e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 98, 100). At the same time, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> was probably 
                            communicating the methodicalness recommended by educators. The parents in <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Early Lessons</hi>
                            are likewise measured in their approach, the mother saying to a child that she will answer questions at her leisure, and only if the child minds and remembers the answer; and the father checking overly
                            eager inquiry, since &#x201C;thinking, without tiring ourselves, is very agreeable; but thinking becomes disagreeable, if we tire ourselves.&#x201D; Frank is frequently exhorted to save until later
                            what he cannot comprehend immediately (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHWORKS">Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 12:<!--Entry needed here.-->). In <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi>, procedures are systematic and graduated, starting with simpler concepts in mechanics and astronomy (vol. 1), and progressing
                            through hydrostatics and pneumatics (vol. 2), and finally optics, magnetism, electricity, and galvinism (vol. 3). Thus, in her letters, when <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> attempts to
                            order <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s (and his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s) play by insisting that he finish one project before taking up another
                            (e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 187),
                            her methodicalness is in keeping with <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s advice to balance the spirit of inquiry with management of the gradations of difficulty.</p>
                        <p>As suggested in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>, <persName corresp="#ME">Maria Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s lessons, while best known for encouraging children to learn 
                            through their own observation and discovery, in fact depicted a complex dynamic of observation with memory. Frank learns to analyze a passage of verse by 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="darwin_erasmus_note.php"><persName corresp="#ED">Erasmus Darwin</persName></ref> 
                            by observing for himself in nature the phenomena that <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> describes using both poetic metaphor and exact naturalistic description. The culmination of the lesson, however, 
                            is Frank&#x02BC;s recitation of the verse, learned &#x201C;by rote&#x201D; from the printed text 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHWORKS">Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 12:195&#x2013;203); 
                            the verse is from <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi>, part 2 (&#x2018;The Loves of the Plants&#x2019;), canto 1 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DARWINWORKS">Darwin, <hi rend="italic">Poetical Works</hi></ref>, 2:2&#x2013;3).</p>
                        <p>Yet if <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> has his fictional Mamma adopt this methodical approach, he himself
                            is not so easily restrained. In &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; in response to Mamma&#x02BC;s declaration, &#x201C;Well I think we have had thought enough for the present,&#x201D; Lucy returns &#x201C;just two or three
                            questions&#x201D; more (chap. 1). Defying <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s system, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> puts his Harry and Lucy in the middle of the curriculum&#x2014;Harry, the text declares, &#x201C;must begin with pneumatics,&#x201D;&#x2014;and even within that advanced
                            topic, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s text works generally backwards through <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s series of experiments, starting with most advanced. While <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Harry does appear to grasp the central
                            purpose of <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s experiments in pneumatics&#x2014;that they are meant to investigate atmospheric &#x201C;pressure and springiness,&#x201D; as Harry puts it (chap. <!--Entry needed here.-->)&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>
                            and the Edgeworths would have expected the seven-year-old <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to work his way gradually through experiments appropriate to his age, such as
                            Frank&#x02BC;s exploration of the more fundamental concept of experimentation generally, using the homely trial of testing for effective ways to mend a broken
                            saucer (see <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi>, part 2, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#FRANK">Maria Edgeworth, <hi rend="italic">Frank</hi></ref>,
                            1:123&#x2013;31). Instead, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s determination to have his own way with the system is not only precocious, but enamored of
                            spectacle. He seems to relish the fancier hardware in <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s later chapters, and consequently sacrifices preparatory concepts.</p>
                        <p>This precocious behavior was not necessarily so much resistant as energetic. In <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s letters about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s behavior leading up to <date when="1826">1826</date>, 
                            while she does discuss discipline (especially during <date notBefore="1819-02-08" notAfter="1823-02-07"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s first three years</date>), she more frequently remarks his &#x201C;busy&#x201D; activity and &#x201C;chatting&#x201D; (as well as attentive listening) 
                            (e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 108, 116, 126, 128). The sheer bustle of his precocious writing and drawing was also probably directed 
                            at managing his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s absences on business. In &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; it is striking that the episodes copied
                            from <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName> center on the father character, whereas <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s lessons for younger children, like <persName corresp="#ALB">Barbauld</persName>&#x02BC;s, engage father and mother 
                            equally in the conversational method. The respective prominence of father or mother, in <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName> as in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, is to an extent a function of the early <date notBefore="1837-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">Victorian</date> household. 
                            In <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s lessons for younger children, such as <hi rend="italic">Frank,</hi> the boy and his mother are necessarily often together; and just so,
                            in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s earlier chapters, his Harry and Lucy 
                            must appeal to Mama since &#x201C;papa has gone out to town&#x201D; (chap. 1). <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, however, as the traveling partner of his firm, spent especially long weeks away from home, 
                            and his <persName corresp="#JR">son</persName> became caught up in <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s anxieties for <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>&#x02BC;s safety and health. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may even have attributed his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s absences to a guilty sense of own &#x201C;bad&#x201D; behavior 
                            (e.g., <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 109, 116). It is perhaps not surprising, then, 
                            that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would have used precocious writing in some sense to conjure his <persName corresp="JJR#">father</persName>&#x02BC;s presence.</p>
                        <p>That this desire drove <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> especially in his copying of text beyond his years was registered by
                            <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> when <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>, soon after completing &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1, and MS I, produced what she called his &#x201C;first written letter&#x201D; (either meaning 
                            the first letter he wrote himself, as opposed to dictating, and to be sent to his <persName corresp="#JJR">Papa</persName> directly, or meaning the first letter he wrote in longhand&#x2014;or both). <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> observes: 
                            &#x201C;I believe the showing you his writing occupied his thoughts fully more than how he expressed his feelings so you must excuse that,&#x201D; 
                            as &#x201C;he is much delighted at being able to use pen &#x0026; ink&#x201D; 
                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi>, 156</ref>). Just as <persName corresp="ME#">Edgeworth</persName> urges her child characters to use their 
                            &#x201C;own little eyes&#x201D; in dynamic relation with (not necessarily in opposition to) learning &#x201C;by rote,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> copies dialogues with <persName corresp="#JJR">Papa</persName> at the end of &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;
                            because the performance was, for him, related, not opposed, to the absent father at the start who &#x201C;fear[s] I shall not have time&#x201D; to hear Lucy&#x02BC;s lesson (chap. 2).</p>
                        <p>If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s text exhibits impatience with <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s system, his verbal and pictorial illustrations reveal a steady advance in
                            the writer&#x02BC;s ability to represent complex relationships. In the &#x201C;plates&#x201D; at the beginning of MS I, which are
                            among the earliest surviving drawings by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, objects are lined up on a single plain, but later plates attempt more complex spacial relationships.
                            Similarly, in verbal terms, the first portion of the narrative lines up events in simple sequences, whereas, toward the end, the representation of
                            journeying inspires a more serpentine and surprising description like this one: &#x201C;they climbed a high hill and went on sometimes by the
                            sides of rivulets at other times half rubbing against hedges but oftenest so attracted by the bubbling of a pure clear stream that they were like to jump
                            <hi rend="italic">into</hi> it they went through dark avenues and between hedges forming a sort of foot-path sometimes a full view of the sea
                            sometimes none at all till unexpectedly they arrived at home&#x201D; (chap. 8). Apropos of this increasing sophistication, the experiments from <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>, which are clustered
                            in chapters 8 and 9, may have interested <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> because of the language required to explain multiple and complex causal relationships.</p>
                        <p>At the end of his adaptation, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s imitation culminates in a
                            tour de force combining science and poetry&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi> and 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="byron_note.php"><persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName></ref>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi>&#x2014;in
                            Harry&#x02BC;s &#x201C;witch of the alps&#x201D; fantasy (chap. 10), which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made famous by reproducing in facsimile in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>. Poetry is not alien to <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s
                            lessons, and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName> ornaments his dialogues with verse quotations, but their improving works are more apt to quote <persName corresp="#ED">Erasmus Darwin</persName> than <persName corresp="#GGB">Byron</persName>.
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does adapt <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName> for part of the <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</ref> 
                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="the_steam_engine_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION">&#x201C;When furious up from mines the water pours&#x201D; [&#x201C;The Steam Engine&#x201D;]: Discussion</ref>). 
                            But in Harry&#x02BC;s vision closing &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> goes beyond the verse ornamentation of scientific prose
                            to reveal a keen consciousness of the pleasures of crossing genres, for Harry is &#x201C;affected&#x201D; by witnessing &#x201C;in the clouds something like&#x201D; an image from a poem.</p>
                        <p>What &#x201C;affects&#x201D; Harry is possibly psychological as well as literary. For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, Harry and Lucy&#x02BC;s
                            adventures at a <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="seaside_resorts_note.php">seaside resort</ref> like <placeName corresp="#HASTINGS">Hastings</placeName> would have represented a joyful release from a period of grief and loneliness
                            earlier in the year. Business had kept <persName corresp="#JJR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s father</persName> from home for an unusually extended period, and a fatal illness had deprived the boy
                            of his cousin <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_james_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRPSON">James Richardson</persName></ref>&#x02BC;s companionship forever (see <ref type="apparatus" target="on_scotland_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Scotland&#x201D;</ref>).
                            This deprivation may have influenced <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s decision to imitate the Edgeworths&#x02BC; partnership of Harry and Lucy. Not only would the fictional pairing have
                            compensated him for losses; their activities together could have played out and controlled in fiction what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> could not control in
                            life&#x2014;as when Lucy is made to bide the time, first, of a busy father, and, immediately afterward, of a preoccupied brother (chap. 2).</p>
                        <p>Some episodes in &#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D; seem particularly poignant and psychologically suggestive, such as the children&#x02BC;s
                            kidnapping their mother and imprisoning her in Harry&#x02BC;s &#x201C;cave,&#x201D; where she must attend to one of
                            Harry&#x02BC;s &#x201C;schemes,&#x201D; a procession of birds (chaps. 4&#x2013;5). Fantasy may also enter into the concluding
                            &#x201C;witch of the alps&#x201D; episode with its spectral female form. The passage, with its exchange of negative and positive electrical
                            discharges, might be read as an attempt to control and neutralize some sort of trouble.</p>

                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>), which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> meant,
                        according to his title page, to extend to four volumes (see <ref type="internal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>). Ultimately, the project reached only
                        three volumes (&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1; <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol2_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 2</ref>;

                        unfinished. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was generally correct, therefore, when he wrote in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> that the series is unfinished, although he
                        inaccurately accuses himself of having &#x201C;accomplished but one and a quarter&#x201D; volumes (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:52). Possibly this mistake arose because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not have at hand all the
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> containing &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; an oversight evidenced by his having notated in <date when="1870">1870</date> only three of the notebooks as
                        &#x201C;No. 1,&#x201D; &#x201C;No. 2,&#x201D; and &#x201C;No. 3.&#x201D; Of these, only Red Book No. 3 (MS I) and Red Book No. 2 (MS III) contain &#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D;&#x2014;volumes 1 and 2, respectively, of the work&#x2014;and
                        since volume 2 takes up only 21 of the 82 numbered pages in MS III, it seems clear that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> mistakenly figured one volume plus a quarter based on an incomplete reckoning of the Red Books.</p>
                    <p>Differing kinds of composition may be suggested by physical evidence. At points where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> copies nearly verbatim from a source, 
                        <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES">Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></ref> (see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION"> Discussion</ref>), 
                        the text abruptly shows the kind of errors associated with transcribing (e.g., words stricken through, because the writer has inadvertently omitted text and must reinsert it). Such text starts with the
                        discussion about silkworms<!--Fact need checking.-->.</p>
                    <p>Despite this physical evidence, copying and invention were as dynamically related as they were opposed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s development as a writer. First, copying was how <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> learned to write. 
                        In <date when="1823">1823</date>, Margaret Ruskin remarked that &#x201C;he is beginning to copy from his books and will soon learn himself to write I think,&#x201D; and at this point <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s most legible writing consisted of his signature, 
                        which he presumably learned by imitation. Second, copying was integrated within the dynamic of writing by the family as a whole. As his so-called first letter, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dictated to his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>, who wrote &#x201C;word for word what he pretended to read from his paper&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 128). Third, imitation was a significant feature of educational methods of the time, 
                        but such practices did not necessarily train only rote memory: see <ref type="internal" target="#DISCUSSION">Discussion</ref>.</p>
