                     Following stanza 11, or possibly inside that stanza, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inserts a poem separately titled &#x201C;January,&#x201D; consisting of 32 lines, each line typically consisting of two anapests.</p>

                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drafted stanzas 1&#x2013;5 in an even hand with no deletions and only one insertion. (A substitution of &#x201C;aimed&#x201D; for &#x201C;feigned&#x201D; in stanza 3 is in the hand of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>). Alterations become more frequent starting with stanza 6, which he drafted through 5 lines and then cut by scoring with diagonal lines. 
                       Despite this deletion, he numbered the following two stanzas as 7 (which contains three significant substitutions) and 8, respectively, but then he apparently noticed his miscounting and, to compensate, duplicated the number 8 for the following stanza.
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> resumed drafting with no deletions or substitutions. (The facsimile gives the appearance of his having labeled stanza 10 incorrectly as 5, but this illusion is caused by a tear in the page, showing the numeral 5 from the page beneath). After stanza 11, however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> makes a significant departure from the dominant stanza, rhyme, and meter pattern by inserting a 32&#x2010;line poem titled &#x201C;January&#x201D; using shorter, anapestic lines. At the top of the page, he sketched stresses in three&#x2010;syllable feet which may or may not match specific lines of this poem, but which show <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s experimentation with meter.
                        The idea for &#x201C;January&#x201D;  appears to be introduced at the end of stanza 11: &#x201C;I sing the year. Ye months, come listen all / That is if ye have any years atall&#x201D;. Was <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> toying with composing a poem describing each of the twelve months, like a minor Shepherd&#x02BC;s Calendar? Ultimately, in the fair copy, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> deleted the entirety of this poem; and already, in the draft of stanza 12, he incorporated descriptions of the months of January, February, and March into  a single stanza, suggesting that he abandoned the expansion after drafting only the first month.
                        What is significant about this episode in the draft is that, although abandoning &#x201C;January&#x201D; along with a possible expansion of the New Year&#x02BC;s ode, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have found an idea for what became &#x201C;<title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONTHS">The Months</title>&#x201D; as published in <title type="annual" corresp="#FRIENSHIPSOFFERING1835">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</title>. While that poem is not a month&#x2010;by&#x2010;month catalog, it does pick up with the condensed rehearsal of the twelve months as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> went on to draft in stanzas 12&#x2013;14. 
                       On this evidence, one  should not conceive of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> as a precocious but innocent youthful author, whose verse was subsequently edited and polished by his <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> and <persName corresp="#WHH">editor</persName>, but as an ambitious writer who wrote with an eye to publication at the same time that he was composing an apparently private gift of verse for a family holiday occasion.
                        This interpretation is seconded by the hand of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s father in the draft. In stanza three of the draft, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> attested to his ambition, albeit with affected modesty: &#x201C;You know, Sir, that I always feigned to be / At least a something more than common rhymer&#x201D;. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>, however, changed &#x201C;feigned&#x201D; to &#x201C;aimed&#x201D; in the draft. 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s more modest &#x201C;feigned&#x201D; indicates he has always wanted to be worthy of being more than a common rhymer. His <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName>&#x02BC;s more confident &#x201C;aim&#x201D; urges him to work toward becoming a great poet. In writing for the household, <persName corresp="#JJR">father</persName> and <persName corresp="#JR">son</persName> were already staging greater ambitions.
