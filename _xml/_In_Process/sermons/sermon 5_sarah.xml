                    <head type="chapter">The character of Abraham</head>
                    <p>1st verse XXIV.  And <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> was old
                    <lb/>and well stricken, in years, and the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> 
                    <lb/>had blessed <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> in all things.  I 
                    <lb/>have read these verses, in order to make 
                    <lb/>some observations on the history, char
                    <lb/>acter, and religion of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, as an 
                    <lb/>illustration of the faith and obedience, of 
                    <lb/>which he sets us so striking an example.
                    <lb/>Now I should premise that although we 
                    <lb/>often consider religion, generally, as a cr
                    <lb/>eed of outward institutions, and although 
                    <lb/>it is fitting so to do, yet it is also ne
                    <lb/>cessary, that we should consider it, as 
                    <lb/>embodied in some of the principal
                    <lb/>characters which are held forth, for our 
                    <lb/>imitation, in the holy <title type="scripture" corresp="#BIBLE">scripture</title>s.  For
                    <lb/>religion, as drawn by the pen of in
                    <lb/>spiration, is entirely perfect, both in 
                    <lb/>its injunctions, and in its ordinan&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ces, but as it appears in character, 
                    <lb/>it is imperfect sometimes distorted, its 
                    <lb/>injunctions are forgotten, and its ordi&#x2010;
                    <lb/>nances are not observed, which is entire
                    <lb/>ly caused by the imperfection of man, 
                    <lb/>not of religion.  Yet, it will be profita
                    <lb/>ble for us to observe how far, and how 
                    <lb/>perfectly, religion can be embodied, in 
                    <lb/>the character of any human creature 
                    <lb/>and thus, and thus only we shall be a
                    <lb/>ble to feel, and to lament the great&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ness of our own coming short.  
                    <lb/>Without therefore, yielding one title, of 
                    <lb/>the influence, and perfect excellency of 
                    <lb/>religion, we wish to see how far that 
                    <lb/>influence extends itself, over the life,
                    <lb/>the actions, and the character, of this 
                    <lb/>great patriarch.  Now, the history of</p>

                    <lb/><p><persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, is not that, of a young and 
                    <lb/>inexperienced convert, it is not of the first 
                    <lb/>enthusiasm, and budding of religion, but of
                    <lb/>the steady and undeviating piety of an ag
                    <lb/>ed, and venerable man, of one who has 
                    <lb/>been much tried. and whose trials having
                    <lb/>been passed through with glory, and with 
                    <lb/>honour, have only caused him to come
                    <lb/>forth like refined gold from the furnace 
                    <lb/>he was old, and stricken in age, and the 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> had blessed him in all things.</p>
                    <lb/><p>We shall now proceed to consider the var
                    <lb/>ious points of the history of the patriarch
                    <lb/>and the example, which they present us 
                    <lb/>with.  The conduct of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> through
                    <lb/>out the whole of his life, is, in the first 
                    <lb/>place, a most striking illustration of faith 
                    <lb/>and this faith was realized in his every 
                    <lb/>action. and indeed, in the very first action
                    <lb/>of which any mention is made.  He was 
                    <lb/>told to leave his house, his family, his coun
                    <lb/>try, but for what compensation?  He is not
                    <lb/>told where is his residence to be.  He is not 
                    <lb/>told.  What is the use of the sacrifice.  He is 
                    <lb/>not told.  The place in which he had been 
                    <lb/>brought up, where his affections must have
                    <lb/>been centred, and with which recollections
                    <lb/>most dear to him must have associa&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ted, must be left in order to go to an un
                    <lb/>known land, of which nothing whatever
                    <lb/>is told <del rend="strikethrough">us</del> him.  Now, had <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, in
                    <lb/>stead of exercising faith required evidence 
                    <lb/>farther evidence than the voice of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, it is
                    <lb/>possible, that on account of this hesitati
                    <lb/>on, he might have been disinherited,  The 
                    <lb/>only evidence which he had, or which he 
                    <lb/>asked for, was, the certainty that <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>had spoken, and all, except this, was en
                    <lb/>tirely unsatisfactory.  Oh, that we could
                    <lb/>be contended to do thus, to believe the 
                    <lb/>promises of <title type="scripture" corresp="#BIBLE">Scripture</title>, without prying in
                    <lb/>to the future and to receive the word of
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, as sufficient testimony.  But, it
                    <lb/>may be asked, if we receive the testimony 
                    <lb/>of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> in any other way than that, in 
                    <lb/>which it was accepted by <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, and
                    <lb/>before I answer this question, I would,
                    <lb/>observe how exceedingly different are the
                    <lb/>circumstances in which we are placed, from
                    <lb/>those in which we have found <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> 
                    <lb/>exercising his faith <del rend="strikethrough">so</del> in such an unqual
                    <lb/>ified, and unhesitating manner.  We have
                    <pb facs="296805v_0028"/>
                    <lb/>seen these promises fulfilled, which had only
                    <lb/>been made to <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, we have seen the
                    <lb/>birth of that <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">redeemer</persName>, on whom it was 
                    <lb/>faith only which enabled <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> to be
                    <lb/>lieve, and during a lengthened series of 
                    <lb/>ages, we have seen the christian church
                    <lb/>passing through <del rend="strikethrough">?</del> severe and numberless 
                    <lb/>trials and passing through them with vic
                    <lb/>tory, and triumph, We stand on ground in
                    <lb/>finitely superior to that on which <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>
                    <lb/>stood, and under these circumstances,&#x2014; I
                    <lb/>would answer, that I very much doubt, 
                    <lb/>if we atall accept the word, in the man
                    <lb/>ner in which it was accepted by <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName><!--"ham" on next line-->,
                    <lb/>If the word of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> were, indeed, 
                    <lb/>thus received, should we not be inclined to 
                    <lb/>enquire more closely and  more constantly
                    <lb/>into the <title type="scripture" corresp="#BIBLE">Scripture</title>s, into that which is 
                    <lb/>the very ground of our faith.  I think, that
                    <lb/>if we did receive the word thus unqualifi
                    <lb/>edly, without <del rend="strikethough">dis</del> endeavoring to under

                    <lb/>hath placed above our comprehension, there
                    <lb/>would be more unity of action, and prac

                    <lb/>system, I consider, that the petty, and in

                    <lb/>commanded us.  It was no light thing
                    <lb/>nor one that in any <del rend="strikethrough">ther</del> other case would
                    <lb/>have been entered upon without long &#x0026; 
                    <lb/>mature consideration, that <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> should 
                    <lb/>leave his family and his friends, his home 
                    <lb/>and his country to go into a strange, and 
                    <lb/>unknown land, whose inhabitants, if it
                    <lb/>had other inhabitants than the wild beasts 
                    <lb/>of the field, knew nothing of the <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> whom
                    <lb/>he worshipped and obeyed, It had been 
                    <lb/>long, ere <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> in such a circumstance
                    <lb/>as this, had followed the advice of the wi

                    <lb/>then been after much doubt and deep de

                    <lb/>of the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName>, he complied at once, and his com

                    <lb/><!--?-->I should question the wisdom of man, if it

                    <lb/>under these circumstances and in our way 
                    <lb/>of receiving the word of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, these opp

                    <lb/>but he knows that he is a creature with

                    <lb/>continually in view was, Shall not the

                    <lb/>and spotless in itself, but we never
                    <lb/>find it so in the history of man, be

                    <lb/>Now had <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> been entirely per

                    <lb/>found religion embodied purely em
                    <lb/>bodied in his character, in contradic
                    <lb/>tion to all other experience. But he was
                    <lb/>not perfect, he deviated from the path
                    <lb/>of religion in many circumstances and
                    <lb/>those not unimportant ones, When he

                    <lb/>he told the truth when he said she

                    <lb/>the wickedness in him, was, therefore 
                    <lb/>also equal.  When we consider, that
                    <lb/>this was the same man who would un
                    <lb/>hesitatingly have sacrificed his son at 
                    <lb/>the command of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, is it not a won

                    <lb/>&#x201C;the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh

                    <lb/>the failings of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> are told us,
                    <lb/>and there are two reasons, First, it was
                    <lb/>to bring evidence, of the truth of the nar
                    <lb/>rative, For had <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> been held
                    <lb/>up to us, as perfect religion embodied, 
                    <lb/>as faultless, had the history of his faith
                    <lb/>his love his justice, alone been given to
                    <lb/>us, this handle would be at once have
                    <lb/>been seized upon by infidelity, and the
                    <lb/>accuracy of the whole narrative would 
                    <lb/>have been questioned, if not its truth
                    <lb/>as being in entire contradiction to the
                    <lb/>maxims inculcated by the <title type="scripture" corresp="#BIBLE">Scripture</title>s 
                    <lb/>and confirmed by experience.  And sec
                    <lb/>ondly, that the conduct of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> 
                    <lb/>might be constantly held up to all
                    <lb/>posterity, as an example, which not on
                    <lb/>ly ought to imitated, but which
                    <lb/>in some degree, might be so.  For
                    <lb/>we again repeat, that if we had not
                    <lb/>been informed of the failings of the
                    <lb/>patriarch, and he had been held up
                    <lb/>to us entirely perfect, we should have
                    <lb/>affirmed that the model was beyond 
                    <lb/>our imitation, and that either the man
                    <lb/>who attained to such a high degree of
                    <lb/>perfection. must have been gifted with
                    <lb/>powers <del rend="strikethrough">to</del> much superior to ours,&#x2014;or

                    <lb/>else, must have been placed in totally 
                    <lb/>different situations, and which were 
                    <lb/>much more favourable.  Thus, hav

                    <lb/>eral rule, by which to guide himself
                    <lb/>in all difficulties, this was, to ask. if 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> had spoken, if so, <del rend="strikethrough">to</del> instantly to 
                    <lb/>obey, without even so much as reason
                    <lb/>ing upon the subject, and it was 
                    <lb/>only when he forgot himself, and 
                    <lb/>deviated from this general rule, or line 
                    <lb/>of conduct, that he was drawn into
                    <lb/>into any failing like that which we
                    <lb/>have been considering.  It is neither 
                    <lb/>said that <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> was comman
                    <lb/>ded to go into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>. nor that he
                    <lb/>asked <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> whether it were fitting so 
                    <lb/>to do, No, we are told that he fear
                    <lb/>ed for his flocks, and for his herds, be
                    <lb/>cause of the famine that prevailed, 
                    <lb/>through the land, it was entirely a 
                    <lb/>selfish consideration, which induced him
                    <lb/>to go down into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, and therefore, 
                    <lb/>not being under the protection of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>he was first encompassed by danger, &#x0026; 
                    <lb/>then induced to commit crime, in order, 
                    <lb/>to escape.  We may learn from this, that
                    <lb/>it is necessary constantly to adhere to our
                    <lb/>fundamental<!--y--> principles, if we deviate from
                    <lb/>those but a very little, we are gone

                    <lb/>There is another remarkable failing of 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, which remains to be noticed
                    <lb/>his taking <persName corresp="#HAGAR">Hagar</persName> to be his wife, It is true 
                    <lb/>that <persName corresp="#ISHMAEL">Ishmael</persName>, the son of <persName corresp="#HAGAR">Hagar</persName> was under 
                    <lb/>divine protection but it was not by him 
                    <lb/>that the promises were to be fulfilled.  The
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> had expressly said, In <persName corresp="#ISAAC">Isaac</persName> shall 
                    <lb/>thy seed be called, and it was not by
                    <lb/>his command, that <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> took 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#HAGAR">Hagar</persName><!--"Ha" on previous line-->. and the after circumstances as
                    <lb/>might have been expected, ended evilly 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#SARAH">Sarah</persName> believed imperfectly, that is, she
                    <lb/>believed that the promises would be ful
                    <lb/>filled, but she could not trust the man
                    <lb/>ner of it to the <persName corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName>, and as this 
                    <lb/>manner was above her comprehension
                    <lb/>she endeavoured to fulfill<del rend="strikethrough">ed</del>, them, in 
                    <lb/>her own way, and it was the part of 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> to have resisted her.  But we
                    <lb/>see, that here again he forgot himself 
                    <lb/>and yielded, therefore, let us hencefor
                    <lb/>ward look up to him, as a man of 
                    <lb/>like passions with ourselves, let us com
                    <lb/>pare our history and our circumstan
                    <lb/>ces with his, and let us endeavour, if
                    <lb/>it be possible, to follow in the path in 
                    <lb/>which he has preceded us, but, with stron
                    <lb/>ger faith, purer love, and holier devotion.</p>
