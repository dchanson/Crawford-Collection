                    <l>But ah far too swift flew the moments away</l>

                    <l>Regretting that now from its bosom we drove</l>
                    <l>Towards the wild moors of <placeName corresp="#PENRITH">Penrith</placeName> we silently rove</l>
                    <l>Through the glen of the Greta a passage we found</l>

          <!--10--> <l>And round the huge <geogName corresp="#BLENCATHRA">Saddlebacks</geogName> forehead we wound</l>
                    <l>By the bye I should think he,d a good deal of sense <!--comma instead of apostrophe see manuscript--></l>
                    <l>For although his huge Fate be prodigiously dense</l>
                    <l>And although very leaden be his comprehension</l>
                    <l>Yet his forehead Im sure is of mighty extension</l>
          <!--15--> <l>And sir you perhaps may be now recollecting</l>
                    <l>There are plenty of brains where the foreheads projecting</l>
                    <l>The morning was lovely The bright azure sky</l>
                    <l>With light fleecy clouds it was studded on high</l>
                    <l>As if <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUPITER">Jupiters</persName> sheep from their fold they had strayed </l>
          <!--20--> <l>And oer their blue meadows a ramble had made</l>
                    <l>Perhaps you will say that the gods had no sheep</l>
                    <l>Sir I will not enter on argument deep</l>
                    <l>But this I will say that you must recollect sir</l>
                    <l>That their goblets of gold were filled brimful of nectar</l>
          <!--25--> <l>And this to th, opinion perhaps may give rise</l>
                    <l>They had plenty of nectarine trees in the skies</l>
                    <l>And as to heir having a good flock of sheep</l>
                    <l>If they drank I should think thy had something to eat</l>

                    <pb facs= "MSVII41v-42r"/>
                    <l>But let me remember To whom do I speak</l>
                    <l>Perhaps to a man who knows nothing of Greek</l>
                    <l>I dont condescend sir to talk to a loon &#x02BC;O&#x02BC;</l>
                    <l>Who perhaps knoweth nothing of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JOVE">Jove</persName> or of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#JUNO">Juno</persName></l>

                    <l>I return to my tale From the mountains emerging</l>
                    <l>Again towards <placeName corresp="#PENRITH">Penrith</placeName> our course we were urging</l>
                    <l><geogName corresp="#HELVELLYN">Helvellyns</geogName> huge ranges arose on our right</l>
          <!--40--> <l>To the left <placeName corresp="#SHAP">Shapfells</placeName> crags at length bounded the sight</l>
                    <l><geogName corresp="#BLENCATHRA">Saddleback</geogName> was behind us and stretching before</l>
                    <l>Was a gloomy expanse of the heathery moor</l>
                    <l>How different the scene which behind us we left</l>
                    <l>How different the scene from which we had been reft</l>
          <!--45--> <l>And through all of us knew that those wishes were vain</l>
                    <l>We all of us wished for the <geogName corresp="#DERWENTWATER">Derwent</geogName> again</l>
                    <l>But now our course changed to the right we wheeled round</l>
                    <l>Toward the range of <geogName corresp="#HELVELLYN">Helvellyn</geogName> a passage we found</l>
                    <l>(<geogName corresp="#MELLFELL">Mellfell</geogName> being past) by that huge ranges side</l>
          <!--50--> <l>Thats farthest from <placeName corresp="#KESWICK">Keswick</placeName> we glady do ride</l>
                    <l>Then entered among the luxuriant woods</l>

                    <l>&#x002A;See note</l>
                    <l>Near <placeName corresp="#GOWBARROW">Gowbarrow Park</placeName> and dark <geogName corresp="#ULLES">Ulles</geogName> floods</l>
                    <l>Ive lost a good rhyme there its <placeName corresp="#GOWBARROW">Gowbarrow park</placeName></l>
                    <l>And the waves of <geogName corresp="#ULLES">Ulles</geogName> water so deep and so dark</l>
          <!--55--> <l>I never lose rhymes they are really the root</l>
                    <l>There are three things that poetry good constitute</l>
                    <l>Good rhymes are the first and good meausure the second</l>
                    <l>And last I believe sense is usually reckoned</l>
                    <l>But never allowed I am sure is digression</l>
                    <l>So of my great sins I will make a confession</l>
                    <l>And hope that for them I may swiftly alone</l>
                    <l>To the reader impatient by now going on</l>
                    <l>Mongst those beautiful woods now was winding the way</l>
                    <l>For here they held almost tyrannical sway</l>
                    <l>Near <placeName corresp="#GOWBARROW">Gowbarrow Park</placeName> on the steep rising heights</l>
                    <l>Forest on forest the vision delights</l>
                    <l>Half nature half art had those forests upreared</l>
                    <l>Till richly they now on the mountains appeared</l>
                    <l>And crested the crags as the plumes of red</l>
                    <l>Wave oer some warriors helmeted head</l>
                    <l>Richly they stand as their foilage bright</l>
                    <l>Feathered and mantled each wave washen height</l>
                    <pb facs= "MSVII42v-43r"/>
                    <l>Till short the road turned and we instant behold</l>
                    <l>A scene that was fit to be graven on gold</l>
                    <l>Right in the front all so dark and so deep</l>
                    <l>Azurely gloomy lay <geogName corresp="#ULLES">Ulleswaters</geogName> sheet</l>
                    <l>Like a lurathan resting there</l>
                    <l>It lay all so mighty so placid and fair</l>
                    <l>Deeply deceitful deceitfully calm</l>
                    <l>As if it were found by some wonderfulcharm</l>
                    <l>As if it were shunning the gorgeous day</l>
                    <l>Mountains embosomed secluded it lay</l>
                    <l>While beyond that so blue and so beautiful flood</l>
                    <l>The might <geogName corresp="PLACEFELL">Place&#x2010;fell</geogName> all so haughtily stood</l>
                    <l>And heaped his huge crags so confusedly high</l>
                    <l>As if boring a hole in the blue coloured sky</l>
                    <l>Blue blue did I say what a monstrous mistake</l>
                    <l>I am positive sir that it really is black</l>
                    <l>What, wouldst contradict me Now sir if you do</l>
                    <l>I tell you Ill beat you both black and blue</l>
                    <l>Now left we our carriage in order to go</l>
                    <l>To a tower which they call <placeName corresp="#LYULPHS">Lyulphs tower I know</placeName> </l>
                    <l>And also I know it belongs to a duke</l>

                    <l>But which to my readers I leave to dispute</l>
                    <l>Where were some fine brews and some huge horns of deer</l>
                    <l>But nothing else worthy of mentioning here</l>
                    <l>But now to our carriage returning we drove</l>

                    <l>With a thou and a thee like the words of a quaker</l>

                    <l>Determined to take a short ramble together</l>
                    <l>And first to the back of the house we went round</l>
                    <l>Where a huge dirty dunghill full quickly we found</l>

                    <l>But we pushed past its dangers in order to try</l>
                    <l>To ascend a small molehill some fifty feet high</l>
                    <l>For though we could hardly call it elevation</l>
                    <l>We thought for a view twas a good situation</l>
                    <l>But scarce had we placed our foot on the first rock</l>

                    <l>Ere the sun and the sky became bright as before</l>
                    <l>So we turned round about and clear scaping their wrath</l> <!--wrath is placed on top of their-->

                    <l>Again trotted on by a different path</l>
                    <l>We came to a bridge a bright streamlet thrown oer</l>
                    <l>Which licked with its ripples the pebbly shore</l>
                    <l>Tis a capital stream for a rod and a float</l>
                    <l>Perhaps for a salmon perhaps for a trout</l>
                    <l>Here and there on the banks spread the roots of a tree</l>

                    <l>Mongst the bright ripples dance or in deep eddies play</l>
                    <l>But dashed on the rocks or all madly hurled oer</l>

                    <l>But we could not afford any longer to stop</l>
                    <l>When we found her so nearly akin to a rock</l>
                    <l>So we called having yielded to her as before</l>
                    <l>Jack hostler heres sixpence and now shut the door</l> <!--Confused as to how to research Jack-->
                    <l>Off rapidly rolled we Postillions two</l>
                    <l>Urged onward the steeds as fast forward we flew</l>
                    <l>And we found as the fellows did whip and did smack its</l> <!--The word its is placed above smack-->
                    <l>Prodigious fine fun to see two yellow jackets</l>
                    <l>And as raising much dust the four horses did jog</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVII49v-50r"/>
                    <l>To see them to see them alternately bob</l>
                    <l>So away from our mind angry feelings all flitted</l>
                    <l>And patiently unto our fate we submitted</l>
                    <l>Now we came to a lake which seemed <geogName corresp="#ULLES">Ulleswaters</geogName> daughter</l>
                    <l>Which they call a romantical Brothers water</l>
                    <l>Because &#x3008;I am sorry to have the relating&#x3009;</l>
                    <l>Two brothers were drowned here once when they were skaitingt</l>
                    <l>It was dear it was small but we soon saw how steep</l>
                    <l>Was the gravelly shore that sloped down to the deep</l>
                    <l>But we liked not its look though its wave was as clear</l>
                    <l>It looked much more suspicious that fair <geogName corresp="#WINDERMERE">Windermere</geogName></l>
                    <l>So we passed by its waters and gan to look round</l>
                    <l>Where the mountains the valley more narrowly bound</l>
                    <l>The fields got more narrow as onward we drove</l>
                    <l>And the stream wandered not by green island or cove</l>
                    <l>More rocky and foamy and splashy it grew sir</l>
                    <l>And began to get into a passionate humour</l>
                    <l>No longer our road by the valley so low went</l>
                    <l>But steeper and steeper it grew every moment</l>
                    <l>Till the dell shot away into three good divisions</l>
                    <l>All holding most mountainous hilly positions</l>
                    <pb facs="MSVII49v-50r"/>
                    <l>The course of the two it is not worth relating</l>
                    <l>But one went straight forward without deviating</l>
                    <l>Up this or by hook by crook we must climb</l>
                    <l>Which we found would take up much of trouble and time</l>
                    <l>But there was unto <placeName corresp="LOWWOOD">Lowwood</placeName> no other approach</l>
                    <l>So picked up resolution and then stopped the coach</l>
                    <l>Though the road was full nearly akin to a river</l>
                    <l>We got out and the carriage we left to the driver</l>
                    <l>And walked up the hill by the side of the stream</l>
                    <l>Which rumbled fantastical rocks all between</l>
                    <l>Now heres a fine place for a plump fifty lines</l>
                    <l>But my muse no such needless extension desgins</l>
                    <l>Because if I wrote upon this any more</l>
                    <l>I should now describe whats been before</l>
                    <l>So through thick and through thin over log over rock</l>
                    <l>I shall carry the reader at once to its top</l>
                    <l>Oh then was a time when we gazed once more</l>
                    <l>Upon <geogName corresp="#WINDERMERE">Windermeres</geogName> woody and waving shore</l>
                    <l>On the gloomy ravine where we first saw the stream</l>
