                    <lb/>security, consequent upon that assur&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ance. Let us therefore consider, how.
                    <lb/>far the pledges and promises, (of the

                    <lb/>ly be entertained, inasmuch as this was
                    <lb/>a period, in which visions, and direct
                    <lb/>communications with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, were, by
                    <lb/>no means uncommon) were, in fact
                    <lb/>redeemed to the ancient Patriarchs, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>in pursuance of this design, I should
                    <lb/>wish first to make a few remarks, upon
                    <lb/>the character of the blessings. And we

                    <lb/>verse, we find the blessing pronounced by

                    <lb/>I will give all these countries, and I

                    <lb/>unto <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> thy father, &#x0026;c.&#x2014;We
                    <lb/>find, that this blessing was essen&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tially the same with that at first pro

                    <lb/>was transferred from father to son.
                    <lb/>by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> himself. It was again trans

                    <lb/>remains a very great indistinctness, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>generality, in the stating of all these
                    <lb/>blessings, which were transferred from

                    <lb/>to <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName>, They are remarkable, be&#x2010;
                    <lb/>cause they combine such a remarka&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ble degree of certainty, with so much
                    <lb/>generality. They were so vague, as to
                    <lb/>leave ample room for the patriarchs
                    <lb/>to exercise their faith and there was
                    <lb/>sufficient and certain evidence to af&#x2010;

                    <lb/>this faith however strong it might
                    <lb/>be, was only extended to the truth 
                    <lb/>of the promises, and not to their ap

                    <lb/>rite of his mother, and she practised fraud
                    <lb/>to obtain for him a blessing, of which, although
                    <lb/>she knew the certain and positive truth
                    <lb/>yet the personal application of&#x2014; which.
                    <lb/>she knew not, We have however, many 
                    <lb/>instances of the same feeling, throughout
                    <lb/>all the lives of the patriarchs, occasioned
                    <lb/>by this imperfect kind of faith, but this
                    <lb/>does not, atall, excuse the proceeding. At
                    <lb/>the present time, we know the certainty
                    <lb/>of general salvation is attested by suf
                    <lb/>ficient evidence, but still, it is dif
                    <lb/>ficult to apply it personally, to bring
                    <lb/>it home to ourselves, there we have
                    <lb/>doubts, and fears, and faulterings, we be
                    <lb/>lieve, but we cannot apply, and we know
                    <lb/>but we cannot trust, It is this, which
                    <lb/>causes us now, not to be sufficiently attach
                    <lb/>ed to the word of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, we hear of the <del rend="strikethrough">word</del> <add place="below"><space quantity="39" unit="chars"/>kingdom</add> of
                    <lb/><persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and we believe in its truth, and yet
                    <lb/>we will not exert ourselves in order to ob
                    <lb/>tain it. I call your own experience to
                    <lb/>witness that this is the fact although it
                    <lb/>might als be inferred <del rend="strikethrough">fr</del> merely from the
                    <lb/>nature of the human mind. Let us es
                    <lb/>cape as much as possible from this kind of 
                    <lb/>feeling which so frequently influenced the
                    <lb/>actions of the patriarchs, and let us en
                    <lb/>deavour to imitate their settled habits, not
                    <lb/>the incidental actions, which sometimes were
                    <lb/>contrary to those habits But it may be
                    <lb/>asked if this state of mind exists now,
                    <lb/>how can we escape from sin&#x2014; Now, the
                    <lb/>promises say. the blood of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> cleanesth
                    <lb/>from all sin, and our only inquiry must 
                    <lb/>be, Have we accepted this blood, For the 
                    <lb/>doubting state of mind must all be traced 
                    <lb/>to unbelief There must be some doubt of
                    <lb/>the testimony of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, if we cannot make
                    <lb/>it ours. There cannot be entire belief in the
                    <lb/>truth combined, with want of faith in per
                    <lb/>sonal application But if, in some cases;
                    <lb/>we find this state of mind on the part
                    <lb/>of the patriarchs, let us observe the particu

                    <lb/>ly, and just, <persName corresp="#REBECCA">Rebecca</persName> must have had a

                    <lb/>by their own views. Can we say, that
                    <lb/>there is nothing done among us at the
                    <lb/>present day, which resembles this action

                    <lb/>would consider the circumstances attendant
                    <lb/>upon the very partial blessings <del rend="strikethrough">of</del> which <persName corresp="#REBECCA">Re
                    <lb/>becca</persName> obtained for <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName>.</p>
                    <p>Again. We cannot dwell upon all the
                    <lb/>circumstances of the life of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, but it
                    <lb/>affords a sufficient number of instances of
                    <lb/>the same feeling, We find in the first place
                    <lb/>providence permitting him to be carried in
                    <lb/>to <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, in order <del rend="strikethrough">that</del> to promote his fu
                    <lb/>ture good and then the famine compell&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing his brethren, to go up into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> for corn
                    <lb/>and we must next consider what influ
                    <lb/>enced the conduct of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> toward his
                    <lb/>bretheren, (neither excusing their wickedness,
                    <lb/>nor forgetting to distinguish the acts of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Jo
                    <lb/>seph</persName>, from his habits) In the first place
                    <lb/>5 verse. of XLII chapter of <title type="scripture" corresp="#GENESIS">Genesis</title>, we are
                    <lb/>told that <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> knew his brethren but
                    <lb/>they knew not him. and this may be
                    <lb/>easily accounted for if we consider, that
                    <lb/>when <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> was last seen by his
                    <lb/>brethren, he was but a youth, and in
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Verso_4"/>
                    <lb/>consequwnce may be supposed to have alter
                    <lb/>ed much more, during the period of at least 
                    <lb/>seven years which must since have elapsed &#x0026; 
                    <lb/>also the circumstance of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> were so com
                    <lb/>pletely altered as to render it difficult for
                    <lb/>his brethren to recognise him, while theirs
                    <lb/>remained exactly the same, But we find
                    <lb/>that although <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> recognised them at
                    <lb/>once, yet he said that they were spies,
                    <lb/>and then adopts a test, swearing, by the
                    <lb/>life of Pharaoh, a profane and idolatrous.
                    <lb/>oath that &#x201C;except your youngest brother.
                    <lb/>come hither ye shall not go forth hence
                    <lb/>Again, during a period of at the very least 
                    <lb/>9 years, although his father was within 
                    <lb/>a very little distance, he made no inquiry 
                    <lb/>after him, it was at least 9 years, for the
                    <lb/>seven years of plenty had past away, and
                    <lb/>we find in the 6th verse of the 45 chapter&#x2014;
                    <lb/>for these two years hath the famine been
                    <lb/>in the land, Therefore without reckoning the
                    <lb/>time which past between <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Josephs</persName> first be
                    <lb/>ing sold into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, and the commencement
                    <lb/>of the years of plenty, and which may have
                    <lb/>been considerable, we find that during a
                    <lb/>period of nine years he showed no anxiety
                    <lb/>about the welfare of his father and made
                    <lb/>no inquiry after him. we might have
                    <lb/>expected that as soon as the famine com&#x2014;
                    <lb/>menced, he would <del rend="strikethrough">have</del> at least then
                    <lb/>have informed his father of his prosper&#x2014;
                    <lb/>ity and desired him to come up into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>
                    <lb/>in order that he might be able to assist
                    <lb/>him, but we find him doing nothing
                    <lb/>of the kind. This conduct was not worthy
                    <lb/>of the rank to which had attained al
                    <lb/>though it was most likely this elevation 
                    <lb/>which affected his principles and caused 
                    <lb/>him act in this manner. I know.
                    <lb/>that the history of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> has been com&#x2014;
                    <lb/>monly held up in quite a different
                    <lb/>light, It has been considered as an entertain
                    <lb/>ing tale, and an excellent example, while,
                    <lb/>on the contrary, the view which I have 
                    <lb/>taken <del rend="strikethrough">Joseph</del> of this subject appears to
                    <lb/>bring down his actions from ideal to real,
                    <lb/>and to the common level of human nat
                    <lb/>ure. and we find that the effect which
                    <lb/>it produced on his brothers was the same 
                    <lb/>as that with which it has struck me (5 verse of 50 chapter) And when <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Josephs</persName>
                    <lb/>brethren saw that their father was dead they
                    <lb/>said &#x201C;<persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> will peradventure hate us and
                    <lb/>will certainly requite us all the evil which
                    <lb/>we did unto him; They were more
                    <lb/>struck with the incident than with
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Recto_5"/>
                    <lb/>the habits, which was probably caused by thier
                    <lb/>being as soon as they came into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, sent
                    <lb/>into the <placeName corresp="#GOSHEN">Land of Goshen</placeName> were being at some
                    <lb/>distance from the court they could not
                    <lb/>have an opportunity of witnessing the hab
                    <lb/>its of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>. The impression on <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName> was,
                    <lb/>we find, the same; Now I do not say this,
                    <lb/>in order to blot a character in other cir&#x2010;
                    <lb/>cumstances so fair, but in order to be enabled 
                    <lb/>to derive benefit from it. Let us always
                    <lb/>flee from pride with abhorrence. Pride 
                    <lb/>was <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Josephs</persName> bane, How much more con&#x2010;
                    <lb/>sistent would it have been, had he sent
                    <lb/>to his fathers home, and communicated.
                    <lb/>with him, informed him of his prosperity
                    <lb/>and invited him to share it. But no, on
                    <lb/>the contrary he adopted the practises of the
                    <lb/>Pagan court in which he was, and instead
                    <lb/>of producing any thing like the object which
                    <lb/>I think erroneously he is said to have
                    <lb/>had in view, namely to <del rend="strikethrough">com</del> soften his
                    <lb/>brethren and cause them to repent, he only
                    <lb/>made them fear him. And, had <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> 
                    <lb/>previously been told of the conduct which
                    <lb/>he afterwards observed toward his breth
                    <lb/>ren he might have said like <persName corresp="#HAZAEL">Hazael</persName>
                    <lb/>to the prophet of <persName corresp="#DAMASCUS">Damascus</persName>, &#x201C;Is thy ser
                    <lb/>vant a dog, that he should do this 
                    <lb/>thing. Let us therefore never say, I can
                    <lb/>not, I will not do this, or that, but
                    <lb/>let us cast ourselves entirely on the will
                    <lb/>of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and thus endeavour to escape from
                    <lb/>the short comings, and cling to the settled
                    <lb/>and exemplary habits of which an example
                    <lb/>is so constantly and steadily held forth
                    <lb/>to us as a lamp unto our feet and a light
                    <lb/>unto our path in the various and remar
