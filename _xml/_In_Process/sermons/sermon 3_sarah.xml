                    <p>We are now to direct our attention, to a 
                    <lb/>few of the principle events, which immed&#x2010;
                    <lb/>iately followed the deluge. 20, of VIII, to end.
                    <lb/>The very first intimation, which<!--HGV omits "which"--> we have 
                    <lb/>of altars being built unto the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName>, is in 
                    <lb/>this passage, and we find, that it was 
                    <lb/>the very first action of <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName>, after he came
                    <lb/>out of the ark.  But although this is the 
                    <lb/>very first positive intimation, which we 
                    <lb/>have, of altars being built unto the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> 
                    <lb/><del rend="strikethrough">i</del>there is no ground to believe that the 
                    <lb/>descendants of <persName corresp="#SETH">Seth</persName>, built no altars.  Nay 
                    <lb/>we have great reason to believe that al&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tars were used, as we are told that they 
                    <lb/>offered sacrifices.  We may infer, from
                    <lb/>this, the first action of <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName>, two things,
                    <lb/>his gratitude, and his obedience.  His<!--HGV reads "This"--> grat&#x2010;
                    <lb/>itude at once led him to build the altar,
                    <lb/>his obedience to the previous ordinances 
                    <lb/>of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> made him bring the animals to be
                    <lb/>sacrificed thereon.  He might well indeed 
                    <lb/>be grateful, for the merciful preservation
                    <lb/>which had been extended to him.  And we 
                    <lb/>thus find that <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName>s very first action
                    <lb/>symbolized the atonement of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>.
                    <lb/>We now find the acceptance of <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName>s offe
                    <lb/>ring announced to us.  We are told.  The 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> smelled a sweet savour, and the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> 
                    <lb/>said in his heart.  I will not again
                    <lb/>curse the ground any more for mans sake
                    <lb/>for the imagination of mans heart is 
                    <lb/>evil continually.  The reason here is re&#x2010;
                    <lb/>markable[.]  The heart of man is so 
                    <pb facs="296805v_0012"/>
                    <lb/>entirely evil from his youth, so utterly deprav
                    <lb/>ed and corrupted, that no expression whate
                    <lb/>ver of divine vengeance, would ever restrain 
                    <lb/>it, and it would be entirely useless continual
                    <lb/>ly to destroy the race of mankind.  But then 
                    <lb/>it may be objected, why did the flood come 
                    <lb/>at all[.]  Why was this terrible judgement 
                    <lb/>executed against mankind, if it was not 
                    <lb/>to have the least effect upon them.  It is 
                    <lb/>remarkable, that the same <del rend="strikethrough">event</del>reason s
                    <lb/>should<!--<"reason s should"...DCH: Is that 's' supposed to be there all by itself like that?--> be given, both for causing the flood
                    <lb/>and afterwards witholding a repetition of 
                    <lb/>it.  Now the deluge was not a trial of
                    <lb/>men,<!--HGV reads "man"--> to see whether any judgement or pun
                    <lb/>ishment would have any effect in causing
                    <lb/>their amendment, it was not an experim
                    <lb/>ment<!--'m' doubled with line break--> of which <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> did not know the result
                    <lb/>but it was to show, the utter hopelessness 
                    <lb/>of reclaiming the children of men, in any 
                    <lb/>other manner, than by their being born a
                    <lb/>again<!--'a' doubed with line break--> in <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>.  There was therefore good 
                    <lb/>reason, both for causing the deluge, and for 
                    <lb/>preventing its repetition.  The next circum
                    <lb/>stance which is to be noticed, is the grant 
                    <lb/>of animal food which <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> made to man 
                    <lb/>at this period.  There was no grant be
                    <lb/>fore made to man, of any thing for food 
                    <lb/>but the products of the vegetable kingdom  
                    <lb/>Still we have reason to suppose that animal 
                    <lb/>food was used before the flood, for all <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>s 
                    <lb/>ordinances were utterly neglected and despised
                    <lb/>by the sons of <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName>[,] but we may infer<del rend="strikethrough">e</del>,
                    <lb/>from the grant now made of animal food,
                    <lb/>that the sons of <persName corresp="#SETH">Seth</persName>, or at least, <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName>, &#x0026; 
                    <lb/>his family, abstained from it and held the 
                    <lb/>divine command in veneration.  But, it may 
                    <lb/>be asked, why was that granted now, which
                    <lb/>was denied before.  It should be remembered
                    <lb/>that the vegetable kingdom must have 
                    <lb/>been partially destroyed, or at least mater
                    <lb/>ially injured, by the operation of the flood, 
                    <lb/>and for some time, vegetables must have 
                    <lb/>been entirely inadequate, for the sustenance 
                    <lb/>of mankind.  Therefore the means of his sup
                    <lb/>port are now enlarged, but at the same 
                    <lb/>time, all cruelty, which might have been 
                    <pb facs="296805v_0013"/>
                    <lb/>consequent upon the introduction of animal 
                    <lb/>food, was forbidden by the following precept
                    <lb/>Verse 4.9.<!--footnote 1: "Check whether 4.9 or 4.4. HGV reads 9."--> flesh with the life thereof which is 
                    <lb/>the blood thereof, shall ye not eat  The next
                    <lb/>circumstance to which our attention is to be 
                    <lb/>directed, is the enforcement of capital pun
                    <lb/>ishment  Whoso sheddeth mans blood, by man<!--HGV reads "such"-->
                    <lb/>shall his blood be shed, and the reason assig&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ned, is the dignity of man, &#x201C;for in the image

                    <lb/>was entirely confided to murder.  Some say 
                    <lb/>that this law, was confined to the economy 
                    <lb/>of <persName corresp="#MOSES">Moses</persName>, but it is, I think, not so.  It was 
                    <lb/>given as the law of the new world, and 
                    <lb/>was intended to go down to the latest
                    <lb/>generations  <persName corresp="#NOAH">Noah</persName> is here the father of the 
                    <lb/>world, and this is the foundation of the 
                    <lb/>criminal law, throughout all the after&#x2010;
                    <lb/>world.  This severe law against murder was 
                    <lb/>rend{e}<!--?-->red necessary by the state of violence 
                    <lb/>which we are told prevailed before the
                    <lb/>flood and in which it is probable that mur
                    <lb/>der was no uncommon circumstance[,] and 
                    <lb/>no ordinance atall less severe than the one 
                    <lb/>under consideration, would have had the 
                    <lb/>least effect in its prevention.</p>
                    <lb/><p>We now pass on, to the token which is 
                    <lb/>given by <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, of the faithfulness of the 
                    <lb/>covenant which he made, not to des&#x2010;
                    <lb/>troy mankind again.  It has been said 
                    <lb/>that as physical nature is such, as, with
                    <lb/>out the intervention of any miracle, to 
                    <lb/>produce the rainbow, by the refraction of 
                    <lb/>the suns rays in the drops of falling rain, 
                    <lb/>the bow must either not have been a to&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ken to mankind, given at this time, or 
                    <lb/>else, that there could have been no 
                    <lb/>rain upon the<!--HGV omits "the"--> earth before the flood.
                    <lb/>For this last hypothesis, we have, on the 
                    <lb/>contrary, ample<!--HGV reads "awful"--> reason to believe that
                    <lb/>there was rain.  5 and 6[,] of II  But there 
                    <lb/>went up a mist from the earth and wa

                    <lb/>the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> had not yet caused it to rain
                    <lb/>upon the earth from which we may in
                    <lb/>fer, that rain followed immediately[,] &#x0026;
                    <lb/>for the first, this is no proof that the 
                    <lb/>rainbow was not a token given by <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, 
                    <pb facs="296805v_0014"/>
                    <lb/>We should rather say that <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName><!--<<g>>od; cap over lc--> selected an

                    <lb/>which was quite sufficient.  After this, 
                    <lb/>we find the whole human race, having 
                    <lb/>collected themselves into one community[,] a
                    <lb/>bout to enter into a scheme of pride and 
                    <lb/>wickedness, which clearly shows how soon
                    <lb/>the depravity incident to man had ag

                    <lb/>to build themselves new cities, or find new

                    <lb/><p>In spite of this however, we find, after 
                    <lb/>their dispersion, the viol{e}nce which preceded
                    <lb/>the flood again commencing[.]  It is said
                    <lb/>that <persName corresp="#NIMROD">Nimrod</persName> was a mighty hunter before 
                    <lb/>the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName>.  Now at this period, when ani&#x2010;
                    <lb/>mals multiplied more than men,<!--HGV reads "man"--> it became 
                    <lb/>of very great consequence, that the more 
                    <lb/>powerful of them, at least, should be des
                    <lb/>troyed.  In consequence, he who excelled in 
                    <lb/>this department would obtain a leadership 
                    <lb/>and authority over his fellow, which after&#x2010;
                    <lb/>wards readily he turned to his own aggran
                    <lb/>dizement.  The hunting of <persName corresp="#NIMROD">Nimrod</persName>, is, on 
                    <lb/>this account, celibrated, and we can have 
                    <lb/>no doubt, that he afterwards took advan
                    <lb/>tage of <del rend="strikethrough">this</del> the authority[,] thus obtained,
                    <lb/>to raise himself to the power and dignity<!--HGV reads "divinity"--> 
                    <lb/>of a monarch, or a tyrant.  I am not speak
                    <lb/>ing just now against monarchy  That is 
                    <lb/>an institution which I consider to have been 
                    <lb/>ordained by <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and which therefore should 
                    <lb/>be honoured by men, and only evil in its 
                    <lb/>origin.  Again[,] it may be supposed, that 
                    <lb/>any individual, who, after the dispersion, first
                    <lb/>led to the building of towns, or the establish
                    <lb/>ment of Colonies, would in the first case,
                    <lb/>be looked up to with respect, or even vene&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ration, which would increase, until, after 
                    <lb/>his death, he might be ranked as a minor 
                    <lb/>divinity[.]  The number of these divinities would 
                    <lb/>be gradually increased, and their actions 
                    <lb/>would, in the course of time, be exaggera
                    <lb/>ted by tradition, till the true, and only <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> 
                    <lb/>would be entirely lost, and this was the o
                    <lb/>rigin of idolatry.  This was the state of 
                    <lb/>abandonment, and idolatry into which the 
                    <lb/>earth was plunged, at the period of the cal

                    <lb/><p>We shall now proceed to draw a few in
                    <lb/>ferences, from the circumstances, which 
                    <pb facs="296805v_0017"/>
                    <lb/>we have seen to day to have been those 
                    <lb/>of the world immediately after the flood  
                    <lb/>I would first notice the desperate and in
                    <lb/>curable wickedness of the human heart; I
                    <lb/>have often spoken of this before, and I speak
                    <lb/>of it again, both because examples of is<!--it?-->
                    <lb/>are constantly introduced throughout the
                    <lb/>whole of the sacred writings, and because it
                    <lb/><!--"and because it" repeated--> is a circumstance which can
                    <lb/><hi rend="underline">not be</hi> too often impressed on the mind of
                    <lb/>every one.  We see, that as soon as any
                    <lb/>individual made himself useful to his fel
                    <lb/>low creatures in any one department he
                    <lb/>employed those powers which he had thus
                    <lb/>obtained, to aggrandize himself<!--"f" written over "v"-->, in short
                    <lb/>to subjugate, and tyrannize over that
                    <lb/>people, for whose benefit he had previous
                    <lb/>ly been labouring.  Again, does not
                    <lb/>the entire absence of religion, from the
                    <lb/>multitude in the plain of <placeName corresp="#SHINAR">Shinar</placeName>, offer
                    <lb/>another remarkable example, of this dread
                    <lb/>ful depravity[.]  Every thing was lost in
                    <lb/>their selfish ness, in their vain glory; in
                    <lb/>their pride; <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> was altogether forgotten
                    <lb/>and mankind gave a loose rein to their
                    <lb/>passions, ending in their own confusion.</p>
                    <lb/><p>Again, we should learn from this, the
                    <lb/>amazing importance of humility.  The fame
                    <lb/>of the builders of <placeName corresp="#BABEL">Babel</placeName>, has, through their
                    <lb/>pride, been perpetuated, but not in the
                    <lb/>manner that they wished, to their glory
                    <lb/>and their honour, but to their abasement
                    <lb/>and degradation.  Had they been found
                    <lb/>worshipping <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> with humility, had they
                    <lb/>built altars, and brought sacrifices, it
                    <lb/>had then been an everlasting monument
                    <lb/>to their glory, and posterity would have
                    <lb/>looked back upon their humility, with res
                    <lb/>peck, and veneration.  But it was not
                    <lb/>so, and their confusion is now an everl&#x2010;<!--"l" doubled with line break-->
                    <lb/>lasting memorial of that truth, that pride
