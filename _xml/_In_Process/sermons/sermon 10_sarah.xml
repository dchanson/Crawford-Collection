                    <p>The 1st chapter of <title type="scripture" corresp="#LEVITICUS">Leviticus</title>, from the
                    <lb/>beginning.  I think that in the re&#x2010;
                    <lb/>marks on the law of <persName corresp="#MOSES">Moses</persName>; which
                    <lb/>are to employ us to obey., it is better to
                    <lb/>enter upon <title type="scripture" corresp="#LEVITICUS">Leviticus</title>, as the book which
                    <lb/>contains more specifically the details
                    <lb/>of the law of sacrifice, which is the
                    <lb/>very foundation of the Mosaic econ
                    <lb/>omy.  We shall first <del rend="strikethrough">fir</del> consider
                    <lb/>the doctrine of atonement here, &#x0026; then
                    <lb/>follow it up to its antitype, the death
                    <lb/>of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>.  Now this is a real form 
                    <lb/>of sacrifice, and a simple form.  It is
                    <lb/>not for a confimation of testimony
                    <lb/>nor announcement, nor instruction
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 005a"/>
                    <lb/>to be communicated.  The priest takes the
                    <lb/>sacrifice in silence, in the open court before
                    <lb/>the tabernacle, where the altar for sac
                    <lb/>rifice was placed. he slays and sprin
                    <lb/>kles the blood round about upon the
                    <lb/>altar.  Now there is nothing here, that
                    <lb/>would lead us to infer any thing
                    <lb/>more, than a simple form of sac&#x2010;
                    <lb/>rifice.  But. in the 4 verse, we are in
                    <lb/>formed, that the man laid his hand
                    <lb/>on the head of the burntoffering and
                    <lb/>it was accepted for him to make
                    <lb/>atonement for him.  Now, nothing can
                    <lb/>be more clear, than that we have here
                    <lb/>a sinner laying his hand on the head of
                    <lb/>the sacrifice, in order to communicate
                    <lb/>the load of his sins and his wickedness
                    <lb/>to the animal  The victim was then
                    <lb/>substituted for him, it bore his punish
                    <lb/>ment, and was accepted for him
                    <lb/>to make atonement for him.  Can
                    <lb/>anything be clearer, than that this
                    <lb/>was merely a scene of sacrifice and of
                    <lb/>atonement.</p>
                    <lb/><p>But we have also another intimat&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tion.  The sacrifice must be appropri&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ate.  Every victim or any victim that
                    <lb/>the man might choose to give, would
                    <lb/>not suffice.  It must be pure, chosen
                    <lb/>out of the flock, a male without ble
                    <lb/>mish, or it will not be accepted
                    <lb/>And the last intimation is, that the
                    <lb/>sacrifice must be offered, of the mans
                    <lb/>own voluntary will.  There was no le&#x2010;
                    <lb/>gal authority that could compel the
                    <lb/>man to bring the sacrifice, he was only
                    <lb/>in case that he withheld it debarred
                    <lb/>from certain religious privileges, which
                    <lb/>were withheld by <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> from him who
                    <lb/>sacrificed not, but he was compelled
                    <lb/>to sacrifice no farther than by being
                    <lb/>threatened with <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>s high displeas&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ure, if he refused.  It is through
                    <lb/>these three points that I wish to fol&#x2010;
                    <lb/>low up the shadow of sacrifice to its 
                    <lb/>substance, <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>.</p>
                    <lb/><p>For. the law was raised up, in order
                    <lb/>to throw forward a shadow to another
                    <lb/>economy which other economy, was,
                    <lb/>we see shadowed forth by sacrifice &#x0026;
                    <lb/>this is explained in the beginning of the
                    <lb/>10<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> chapter, of <title type="scripture" corresp="#HEBREWS">Hebrews</title>, where it is said
                    <lb/>that the law, having a shadow of good
                    <lb/>things to come and not the very image
                    <lb/>of those things, can never with sacrifi
                    <lb/>ces, make the comers thereunto perfect &#x0026;
                    <lb/>and it goes on to say that the blood of
                    <lb/>it goes on to say that the blood of
                    <lb/>bulls and goats can never take away <add type="runover" place="below"><space quantity="29" unit="chars"/>(sin</add></p>
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 006a"/>
                    <lb/><p>Now, if it is impossible, that blood can
                    <lb/>take away sin, can we suppose, that
                    <lb/>these momentous ordinances, were on
                    <lb/>ly for show, for ceremony,  Can <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> in
                    <lb/>stitute any thing of no moral worth
                    <lb/>certainly not.  Then as the law threw
                    <lb/>forward a shadow to another economy
                    <lb/>these sacrifices must be to intimate
                    <lb/>that sacrifice is necessary in the other
                    <lb/>economy and sacrifice, which shall
                    <lb/>be capable of taking away all sin.  Now
                    <lb/>if in the <title type="scripture" corresp="#GOSPEL">Gospel</title> this sacrifice of anim<!--rest of "animals?-->
                    <lb/>is done away with, and yet we know
                    <lb/>that we must have sacrifices of some
                    <lb/>sort, we are shut up to the death of
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>, as the very essence of atonemen<!--t?-->
                    <lb/>The law sacrifices derived their value
                    <lb/>only because they referred to the gos
                    <lb/>pel and if this be correct, the view
                    <lb/>which we have taked of them, must be referred to <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>.</p>
                    <lb/><p>In the first place, <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> has some
                    <lb/>times been erroneously held up, as a
                    <lb/>mere martyr to truth, and it has
                    <lb/>been affirmed, that he died only to
                    <lb/>confirm the truth of his tetimonies
                    <lb/>and not to take away our sin.  Bu<!--t?-->
                    <lb/>he confirmed the truth of his testimony
                    <lb/>by miracles, not by his death, he died
                    <lb/>as a sacrifice, for his death alone could
                    <lb/>not have confirmed <del rend="strikethrough">the</del> his truth
                    <lb/>Pagans have died for their religion
                    <lb/>yet that does not prove the truth
                    <lb/>of Pagnism.  Mahametans have died
                    <lb/>for their religion yet that does
                    <lb/>not prove the truth of Moham&#x2010;
                    <lb/>medanism.  Atheists have died for
                    <lb/>their no religion, yet that does not
                    <lb/>prove that <!--???--> there is no <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>.  Their
                    <lb/>death proves only thier attachment
                    <lb/>to their system, not the truth of that
                    <lb/>system.  The word of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> in no place
                    <lb/>brings forward the death of <persName corresp="#STEPHEN">Stephen</persName>
                    <lb/>as an evidence of the truth of Chris&#x2010;
                    <lb/>tianity.  The death of <del rend="strikethrough">Stephe</del> <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>
                    <lb/>must then be regarded, not as a
                    <lb/>confirmation of his testimony, but as
                    <lb/>a sacrifice for the ungodly.</p>
                    <lb/><p>Again, as the law is a shadow of
                    <lb/>good things to come, and as sacrifice
                    <lb/>is the foundation of the law we have
                    <lb/>a stiking proof of the efficacy of the
                    <lb/>atonement of<persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>.  Now the victim
                        <!--something scrawled between these lines-->
                    <lb/>to be presented in the old law, was
                    <lb/>to be appropriate, and we find that
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 006a"/>
                    <lb/>the <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Saviour</persName> was thus fitting for the a
                    <lb/>tonement he had to make.  He had
                    <lb/>to take upon himself the burde of the
                    <lb/>world, and he was able to do so, he had
                    <lb/>to take away moral guilts, which no cre<!--a?-->
                    <lb/>ture could do, and a creature victim
                    <lb/>would therefore have been rejected; he
                    <lb/>was able to do this also.  We should re
                    <lb/>member that when we wish to offer
                    <lb/>to the <persName corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName> a sacrifice for our
                    <lb/>sins, we have to consider of what value
                    <lb/>the victim will appear to his eyes.  Now
                    <lb/>could any creature have value in the
                    <lb/>sight of the <persName corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName>.  Are not the
                    <lb/>highest of them the mere result of
                    <lb/>his fiat, from the least even unto
                    <lb/>the greatest of them they requite the
                    <lb/>same effort of powe to create them;
                    <lb/>the crawling reptile, and the most ex
                    <lb/>alted archangel, are equally valueless
                    <lb/>as a sacrifice in the sight of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, bec
                    <lb/>ause he could speak a world of such
                    <lb/>beings into existence in a moment.  All
                    <lb/>things are valued by their scarcity &#x0026;
                    <lb/>there is no value whatever attached to
                    <lb/>that which is in rich abundance&#x2010;
                    <lb/>gold is valued because it<!--looks like he missed crossing the 't' twice--> is scarce, but the
                    <lb/>rock in which it is found is not
                    <lb/>valued, because it is plentiful.  As <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>therefore can call every creature in&#2010;
                    <lb/>to existence with equal facility no crea
                    <lb/>ture can be of value in his eyes and
                    <lb/>we are compelled to seek a sacrifice
                    <lb/>beyond creatures, which sacrifice must
                    <lb/>be <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>.  And his death could not
                    <lb/>be held up, unless he were the son of
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>  He must be <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, or he could not
                    <lb/>meet the character of the dispensation
                    <lb/>There is likewise another characteristic
                    <lb/>the man must do it of his own free
                    <lb/>will, and this finally gives us the whole
                    <lb/>character of the new testament dispen
                    <lb/>sation.  For the sacrifice of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> is
                    <lb/>not one to which authority can press
                    <lb/>us, nor with which we can be com
                    <lb/>pelled to connect ourselves.  We must
                    <lb/>have our mind enlightened by the
                    <lb/>demonstrations of the spirit and the po&#x2010;
                    <lb/>wer of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>.  There must be enlighten&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing, before we can lay hold on the sac
                    <lb/>rifice of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName>.  Now the next question
                    <lb/>which must necessarily o<!--??-->ccur to us,
                    <lb/>is, have we done this, and have we done
                    <lb/>it of our free will  For it will not
                    <lb/>suffice if we have only been induced to
                    <pb facs="MS Sermon 007a"/>
                    <lb/>confess <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> by the influence of our
                    <lb/>relations, Influence, or custom are not
                    <lb/>our own free will.  And unless we are
                    <lb/>found voluntarily resting on the new tes
                    <lb/>timent atonement, we are as guilty as
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#NADAB">Nadab</persName> and <persName corresp="#ABIHU">Abihu</persName>, we offer strange fire be
                    <lb/>fore the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> and we must take heed,
                    <lb/>lest their punishment should also light
                    <lb/>upon us.  we are as much guilty of us<!--??-->
                    <lb/>ery of the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName>, as that man would have
                    <lb/>been, who should have brought the vic
                    <lb/>tim to <persName corresp="#MOSES">Moses</persName>, not of his own free will.
                    <lb/>Now, is not this a solemn thing, to lay
                    <lb/>our hand on the sacrifice of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> which
                    <lb/>if we do of our own free will, we shall
                    <lb/>be found in the presence of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> accep&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ting the offering which he has valued
                    <lb/>because it was not that of a creature
                    <lb/>he invites us to draw near and rest on
                    <lb/>this atonement, the substance of the shad
                    <lb/>ow of the Mosaic dispensation, which
                    <lb/>if we do we shall be washed from 
                    <lb/>all our sins and made white in the blood
                    <lb/>of the lamb.</p>
