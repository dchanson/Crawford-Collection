                    <p>24 Verse.III.<!--footnote 1--> Our attention is to be called today
                    <lb/>to the early history of sin, when first intro-
                    <lb/>duced into the world. Had no provisions 
                    <lb/>been made againt it, we should not now 
                    <lb/>have been suprised to find it previal-
                    <lb/>ing, for iniquity, when once established, grows 
                    <lb/>mightier, and mightier by time[.] But it is 
                    <lb/>certaintly more remarkable that sin should 
                    <lb/>prevail, when in the 15, and 24 verses, <!--Footnote 2--> we have 
                    <lb/>a distinct account of the numerous provisions 
                    <lb/>which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> hath made agaisnt it. There is,
                    <lb/>in the 15 verse, a promise a certain promise held 
                    <lb/>out to us, of a means of attainting, in this this our fallen <!--Endnote A-->  
                    <lb/>a degree of happiness, superior even to our former glory  
                    <lb/>through this victory over the serpent, to be obtained  
                    <lb/>by the seed of the woman. Again, in the 24th 
                    <lb/>verse. There have been <!--scratched out illegible letters-->many <!--Endnote b--> disputes, con 
                    <lb/>ceremonial woship or <!--Endnote d--> as symbolizing the pow'rs and attributes of the
                    <lb/>cerning <!--Endnote c--> the nature of Cherubims &#x2038;<add place="above"><space quantity="32" unit="chars"/>as here mentioned</add> but I rather  
                    <lb/>think the most correct opinion is, that they are 
                    <lb/>connected with visions, or ceremonial worship <!--And crossed out-->
                    <lb/>or as symbolizing the pow'rs and attributes of 
                    <lb/>the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> of heaven, and are never used either
                    <lb/>for <!--two illegible word scratched out--> angels, <!--Endnote e--> as some think, or for 
                    <lb/>any kind of living and material beings[.] And 
                    <lb/>I think that this opinion is supported by 
                    <lb/>numerous texts, as that one. He rode upon a 
                    <lb/>cherub, and did fly, yea, he did fly upon the 
                    <lb/>wings of the wind;<!--Footnote 3--> in which I think that 
                    <lb/><persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> is intended to be<!--Endnote f--> represented as accom-
                    <lb/>panied by his pow'r and divine attribrutes, 
                    <lb/>and certainly not literally riding upon any kind
                    <lb/>of <!--two illegible words-->. Now we consider that these
                    <lb/><!--Cherubims?-->, as sybmolizing or connected with
                    <lb/>ceremonial worship, were set up at the east of  
                    <lb/>the Garden of Eden, to furnish man with some
                    <lb/>rallying <!--illegible word--> to worhsip to, some mode of
                    <lb/>still enjoying a degree of communion<!--Endnote g--> with his 
                    <lb/>maker[.] We read also that was a flaming sword, 
                    <lb/>at the east<!--Endnote h--> of the <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#GARDENOFEDEN">Garden</placeName>, to keep the way of the
                    <lb/>tree of life[.] Some think that this flaming sword 
                    <lb/>was in the hands of angels, but it  is far more 
                    <lb/>probable that it was not so, that it was a

                    <lb/>flame folding upon itself, entirely distinct from 
                    <lb/>the cherubims, and for another purpose, namely 
                    <lb/>take away<!--Endnote I--> from man all hope of again entering
                    <lb/>the garden of <placeName type="fictional" corresp="#GARDENOFEDEN">Eden</placeName>, or<!--Endnote J--> of being restored to his former
                    <lb/>condition, and therefore to have recourse to the only 
                    <lb/>mode &#x2038;<add place="above"><space quantity="6" unit="chars"/>of salvation</add> now held out to him, faith in the promises 
                    <lb/>of the victory of the future seed of the woman.-  
                    <lb/>We find in all these circumstances the strongest- 
                    <lb/>possible counteraction of sin[.]  Man can at all-
                    <lb/>times enter into the presence of his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, can-
                    <lb/>have communion with him, can worship to-
                    <lb/>ward him.  How then can sin so prevail[.]<!--Endnote J--> Let- 
                    <lb/>us consider its various stages, as exemplified in the- 
                    <lb/>history of <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> and <persName corresp="#ABEL">Abel</persName>.  It began first by- 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName>'s utter contempt of these ord{i}nances of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>Some say, that as <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> was a tiller of the ground, 
                    <lb/>and <persName corresp="#ABEL">Abel</persName> a keeper of sheep, the offering which each 
                    <lb/>brought, namely <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> of the fruits of his husband-
                    <lb/>ry, and <persName corresp="#ABEL">Abel</persName> of the firstlings of his<!--Endnote L--> flock, befitt[ed] 
                    <lb/><!--two illegible words crossed out-->the<!--Endnote M--> occupation<!--Endnote N--> of each[.]  But it was 
                    <lb/>not so[.]  Sheep were not then, as now, kept 
                    <lb/>for meat, but for Sacrifice only, for publick, 
                    <lb/>sacrifice, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> had ordained that the offer-
                    <lb/>ing of every one should be the same, therefore
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> did not well, in bringing of the first
                    <lb/>fruits of the land, and he offered not by faith  
                    <lb/>There have been doubts concerning the mode by
                    <lb/>which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> expressed his respect or disrespect
                    <lb/>to the offerings of <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> and Abel, but we know 
                    <lb/>that it was a certain one, and it is most 
                    <lb/>probable it was that employed in many  
                    <lb/>other instances, Fire[.]  It was employed in the 
                    <lb/>case of <persName corresp="#GIDEON">Gideon</persName>, of <persName corresp="#MANOAH">Manoah</persName>, of <persName corresp="#SOLOMON">Solomon</persName>, in<!--Endnote O--> 
                    <lb/>that notable case of <persName corresp="#ELIJAH">Elijah</persName>,<!--Footnote 4-->  and most likely  
                    <lb/>here.  Now when cains offering was not accep-
                    <lb/>ted, his contempt of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> increased into enmity
                    <lb/>against man, then followed the murder of his 
                    <lb/>brother, and his consequent expulsion from the  
                    <lb/>presence of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>[.]  Now as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> is omnipresent,
                    <lb/>how could <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> be driven from his presence,  
                    <lb/>unless there were some particular place appointed  
                    <lb/>by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> for his worship and from which <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName>
                    <lb/>was expelled.  Nevertheless, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> determines to
                    <lb/>preserve him, notwithstanding his wickidness
                    <pb facs="296805v_0003"/>
                    <lb/>and therefore he sets a mark upon him, or as I 
                    <lb/>think the expression rather means shows him a  
                    <lb/>miracle, to convince him, that he should not  
                    <lb/>be the subject of common enmity. The &#x2038;<add place="above"><space quantity="38" unit="chars"/>other</add> sons 
                    <lb/>of <persName corresp="#ADAM">Adam</persName>, are now called the sons of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> or<!--Endnote P--> the
                    <lb/>church, while those of <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> are called the sons of  
                    <lb/>men, or the world. <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName>'s Children were the<!--Endnote Q--> 
                    <lb/>authors of the arts and amusements, in order to 
                    <lb/>dispel that gloom with which they were impress'd  
                    <lb/>and therefore whatever uses these arts may be 
                    <lb/><!--illeglible word crossed out-->applied<!--Endnote R--> to at present, we have no rea-
                    <lb/>son to be proud of their origin.  For we read  
                    <lb/>that <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> had two wives, the name of the one  
                    <lb/>was <persName corresp="#ADAH">Adah</persName>, and the name of the other <persName corresp="#ZILLAH">Zillah</persName>[.]  
                    <lb/>And <persName corresp="#ADAH">Adah</persName> bare <persName corresp="#JABAL">Jabal</persName>, he was the father of such  
                    <lb/>as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle<!--Footnote 5-->  
                    <lb/>Now we may ask how Jabal, was distinguished 
                    <lb/>from the other sons of Adam, for they both 
                    <lb/><!--illegible word crossed out-->were<!--Endnote s--> keepers the of sheep or of cattle[.]  But 
                    <lb/>Cains progeny are supposed to have been 
                    <lb/>first who ever used animal food; in direct  
                    <lb/>opposition to the Ordinances of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and thus
                    <lb/>Jabal<!--Endnote T--> was a keeper of Sheep and cattle for 
                    <lb/>food, <persName corresp="#Abel">Abel</persName> only for Sacrifice.  We have thus 
                    <lb/>seen, that the<!--Endnote U--> progeny of <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName> personate 
                    <lb/>the world, and that of <persName corresp="#SETH">Seth</persName>, the Church, 
                    <lb/>and<!--Endnote V--> had this distinction not been broken  
                    <lb/>through, there might never have been a deluge.  
                    <lb/>But we read in the 2nd verse of the sixth chap-
                    <lb/>ter, that the sons of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, (the church,) saw the
                    <lb/>daughters of men, (the world) that they were fair 
                    <lb/>and they took them wives of all whom they
                    <lb/>chose.<!--Footnote 6-->  They were thus blended together, with  
                    <lb/>the approbation, it may be supposed, of the great-
                    <lb/>er part of the sons of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, then we read, that
                    <lb/><!--two illegible words crossed out-->their<!--Endnote W--> progeny<!--Endnote X--> were giants, men 
                    <lb/>of renown, who acquired renown by oppressing 
                    <lb/>each other, thus entered violence, the wicked-
                    <lb/>ness of men became great in the earth, and 
                    <lb/>then came the deluge.<!--Endnote Y-->  We may 
                    <lb/>now derive some general inferences, from these <!--illegilbe word crossed out--> observa 
                    <lb/>tions<!--Endnote Z--> on the state of the world before the flood. 
                    <lb/>We see, that in the midst of mans deepest

                    <lb/>to worship in, and a sacrifice.  And we have in 
                    <lb/>this a clear view of what <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> is to us at present
                    <lb/>He has provided for us a place wherein <!--Endnote BB--> to 
                    <lb/>worship the God of our fathers, and he was also
                    <lb/>provided a sacrifice for us, his son, <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Jesus</persName>.  He  
                    <lb/>demands from us now the same purity of soul, and 
                    <lb/>devotedness of spirit which he demanded then[.]
                    <lb/>But although we find <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> kind and forgiving
                    <lb/>he<!--Endnote CC--> is also a God of Justice, and will not

                    <lb/>long with <persName corresp="#CAIN">Cain</persName>, then took exemplary vengeance,  
                    <lb/>and cast him forth of his presence.  We are 
                    <lb/>exposed to a corresponding punishment, for 
                    <lb/>we insult the same <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and unless we cast
                    <lb/>off our dead works, and turn in time, we are 
                    <lb/>only laying up wrath against the day of wrath 
                    <lb/>and<!--Endnote DD--> the indignation and punishment so

                    <lb/><p>We see from hence the vast importance

                    <lb/>and the children of men  While the children

                    <lb/>decision they were safe, but when that gave 
                    <lb/>way, the two companies united, the barrier 
                    <lb/>was broken down, and they were destroyed
                    <lb/>together.</p>
                    <lb/><p>If we would be found the followers of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>we must never yield to the world, even in 
                    <lb/>thought, for <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> extends the same protection
                    <lb/>to us  now, that he did to one of his people
                    <lb/>then, whom he preserved and sustained,

                    <lb/>ness, and violence was terminated by the
