                    <p>The begninning of the 16 chapter of <title type="scripture" corresp="#LEVITICUS">Leviticus</title>  Last <persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> day, <!--Should I tag Leviticus as a person or as a book-->
                    <lb/>we were considering the importance of observing sacrificial 
                    <lb/>institutions and the example afforded us by <persName corresp="#NADAB">Nadab</persName>, and <persName corresp="#ABIHU">Abihu</persName>
                    <lb/>-To day, our attention is to be directed to the circumstances
                    <lb/>which occurred in the approach of the priest to the holy place.
                    <lb/>after the death of <persName corresp="#NADAB">Nadab</persName> and <persName corresp="#ABIHU">Abihu</persName>. We take up this subject, 
                    <lb/>both as a continuation of the thread of the narrative. <!--Cannot tell if thread is the correct word in the manuscript-->
                    <lb/>and as a farther exemplification of the general character of
                    <lb/>the subject, and evidence of its relation to the atonement of
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#LORD">Christ</persName>  Some may ask, why do we heap up evidence upon evidence.
                    <lb/>to prove what was never doubted  But we answer,  that there may
                    <lb/>be moments of weakness when doubts will thrust themselves upon 
                    <lb/>us in spite of our faith, and a chain of weighty evidence may
                    <lb/>be found exceedingly valuable. Besides the face that this succeeding
                    <lb/>evidence is given to us in the <title type="book" corresp="#BIBLE">Bible</title>, is sufficient to show us that
                    <lb/>it was necessary to inquire into it, it must be useful, or it would
                    <lb/>not have been given to us.</p>
                    <p>Having - thus considered sacrifices first as to their general intention,
                    <lb/>then as applied to the consecration and ministratino of the priest,
                    <lb/>to the atonement for the congregation, for an individual, and for
                    <lb/>the ruler of the people, We have now to consider the manner in which
                    <lb/>the priest was to minister, once in the year, to atone for
                    <lb/>the unknown sins of the congregation not only unwittingly
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA3451_296809_Recto_4"/>
                    <lb/>committed, but unknown, even at the time of atonement  The year
                    <lb/>is supposed to have passed by and the offences committed in that year.
                    <lb/>through ignorance, but afterwards known or recollected, have been atoned
                    <lb/>for, not a moment past after they came to the knowledge of the guilty
                    <lb/>person. before atonement was made for them. But besides thesem there
                    <lb/>might, there must, have been other sins, committed by the congregation,
                    <lb/>of which they not only became guilt through ignorance, but had never
                    <lb/>afterwards discovered, and even at the time of atonement, were not 
                    <lb/>certain, that they had ever committed the sin for which they were 
                    <lb/>atoning, it was only a strong supposition. still, these unknown sins 
                    <lb/>must be expiated. once in the year and that on the part of every individual
                    <lb/>in the congregation  Some may think, that these unknown offenses might
                    <lb/>have been freely pardoned. that sacrifice need not have been again introduced
                    <lb/>here, they had atoned for all known sins, the people could scarcely 
                    <lb/>be said to have disobeyed commands which they knew not, some may think
                    <lb/>this was too much severity and strictness But no, it is not inquired how
                    <lb/>they sinned, but whether. they sinned. Sacrifice is the groundwork of
                    <lb/>atonement and atonement is the groundwork of pardon.</p>
                    <p>Now, in the particulars of this great, and solemn atonement,
                    <lb/>we see that there were two atonements to be offered. 1.st
                    <lb/>for - the priest himself, alone, and not for the general 
                    <lb/>sin of the whole congregation, but for the sin of every 
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296809_Verso_04"/>   
                    <lb/>congregation, but for the sin of every particular person, that is, every person in the whole 
                    <lb/>congregation was not atoned for separately. but the 
                    <lb/>whole ceremony was shut up to the high priest to signify,
                    <lb/>that every individual of the congregation, must be singly 
                    <lb/>atoned for.</p>
                    <p>1st. For the priest himself, The high priest was in the 
                    <lb/>first place, to take a yound bullock, for a sin offering
                    <lb/>for himself alone. We cannot but suppose, that they high 
                    <lb/>priest from so continually sacrificing, and atoning for 
                    <lb/>sin, was particularly alive to its nature, and manner of
                    <lb/>approach, so that sin could scarcely lurk in him, without
                    <lb/>his knowledge. or after discovering for he knew how 
                    <lb/>important it was to keep free from it, and to obey the 
                    <lb/>commands of the Law, and likewise the high priest must, 
                    <lb/>without doubt, have been acquainted with the minutest 
                    <lb/>tittle of those commands, so that he could hardly sin 
                    <lb/>through ignorance, and the fault committed through 
                    <lb/>negligence, or forgetfulness, must have been afterwards 
                    <lb/>discovered, and atoned for. Yet, in spite of all. this, in
                    <lb/>spite of the almost impossibility of the priests committing
                    <lb/>unknown sin, sacrifice must be made for him, and for him. 
                    <lb/>not as - an individual of the congregation, but for him first,
                    <lb/>and alone, that he might be made perfectly pure, before he
                    <lb/>offered the sacrifice for the people  It is useless to think
                    <lb/>of pardon without the intervention of atonement, and sacrifice.</p>
                    <p>2. For the congregation. Now. as we before said, the priest was
                    <lb/>here a representative of the people of <placeName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</placeName>. and. that they might
                    <lb/>be more fully and perfectly represented, all was shut up to him, 
                    <lb/>there were no other priests, not even his sons, to
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296809_Recto_5"/>    
                    <lb/>minister with him. and it is likewise a very singular manner, in which he offered.
                    <lb/>He received two goats from the congregation and one of these he slew,
                    <lb/>for the expiation, while the other escaped, to show the forgiveness <!--Cannot tell if other is the correct word in the manuscript-->
                    <lb/>of unknown guilt thus expiated, The character of individuals is here
                    <lb/>counted as no thing, and pardon is here certainly not granted for
                    <lb/>confession of sin, not for repentance, for that cannot be confessed
                    <lb/>which is not known, neither can it be repented of, except in a 
                    <lb/>general way, but the pardon was granted for expiation of sin by 
                    <lb/>sacrifice, and we therefore see, that here also we remain shut up
                    <lb/>to sacrifice as the only way to escape from the punishment of sin.</p>
                    <p>In the 16 verse, we are told, that atonement must for the tabernacle,
                    <lb/>likewise, because it was unclean. Now, it was not defiled by the 
                    <lb/>touch of any particular individual, but because it was constantly 
                    <lb/>in the midst of an unclean congregation, and the altar must also
                    <lb/>be purified. Now incense is here represented, as offered to the 
                    <lb/>, as<persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> a token of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Gods</persName> acceptance of the sacrifice  The <persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> smelt
                    <lb/>a sweet savour, The perfume of the incense devoted the sweetness of
                    <lb/>the sacrifice and expiation of sin. and the cloud of incense covered
                    <lb/>the mercy seat, when the priest offered sacrifice. to prevent his
                    <lb/>attention being disturbed by the symbolical presence of the <persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> between
                    <lb/>the cherubims, and to prevent idle curiosity being excited and restrain
                    <lb/>all wandering thoughts, because the least deviation from the established
                    <lb/>rule of sacrifice. was punished with death, it was a penalty attached to
                    <lb/>the minutest error. And thus by the incense rising and enveloping by 
                    <lb/>the holy place. the priest was undisturbed, and lefte to contemplate 
                    <lb/>the efficacy of the atonement, which
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296809_Verso_05"/> 
                    <lb/>he was engaged in presenting,and the sacrifice was offered only once in the year, in order to impart
                    <lb/>to it, a greater solemnity and to impress on every individual the 
                    <lb/>vast importance of a full and perfect expiation of unknown sin.</p>
                    <p>The next circumstance which we have to consider, is, that the priest
                    <lb/>in this one particular atonement, was entirely to forget the dignity
                    <lb/>of his character, he was not to remember that he was the high priest,
                    <lb/>and in order to this, he was not to be dressed in his sacrificial robes,
                    <lb/>The breastplate on whose twelve stones were graven the names of the 
                    <lb/>tribes of <placeName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</placeName>, and the mitre, and the ephod, were all to be laid aside,
                    <lb/>he was to be dressed only in simple linen garments, to show his humility
                    <lb/>before <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, but after he had finished sacrificing, and had come out from
                    <lb/>the most holy into the holy placem he was to put on his sacrificial robes,
                    <lb/>before he came out to bless the people. before he came out to tell them
                    <lb/>that this most solemn atonement had been offered, &#x0026; had been offered
                    <lb/>with success. If we reflect that death was the penalty of the slightest
                    <lb/>deviation, and that not only of the priest, but that as the sacrifice would
                    <lb/>in such a case certainly not be accepted, the wrath of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> might be poured
                    <lb/>forth upon the whole congregation of <placeName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</placeName> on account of their unexpiated
                    <lb/>sin we cannot but feel that it must a deeply interesting and solemn, for the
                    <lb/>gathered multitude to have behold their priest entering alone into the holy
                    <lb/>place. to atone for the sins which they knew not ? if they had committed,
                    <lb/>and being doubtful if the agitation which the mind of the priest must in such
                    <lb/>circumstances have been under, might not cause him to commit some error slight
                    <lb/>in the estimation of man, but to which a dreadful penalty was attached by the
                    <lb/><persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName>, and which might cause the rejection of their atonement and then to
                    <lb/>hear the sound of the priests bells in the holy place after he had come out from</p>
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296809_Recto_6"/>
                    <p>the most holy, after having been in such intimate contact with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, it must have been
                    <lb/>a glad sound to the ears of that assembled multitude of doubting and ignorant sinners,
                    <lb/>for it told them that the atonement which they had offered was accepted, and pardon
                    <lb/>granted them, and the remission of their sins.</p>
                    <p>Now, as we have previously pointed out the intention of this. Mosaic economy, and the
                    <lb/>manner of its shadowing forth the sacrifice of <persName corresp="#LORD">Jesus</persName>, &#x0026; as to day we have seen
                    <lb/>how the slightest deviation from this law was punished with death, and how completely
                    <lb/>the Israelites were shut up to their - doctrine of atonement by shedding of blood, it
                    <lb/>follows that we are equally shut up to the doctrine of salvation through the blood of 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#LORD">Christ</persName>. and the great question must then suggest itself. have we indeed come to this 
                    <lb/>all powerful <persName corresp="#LORD">Redeemer</persName>. There were three things connected with the ancient expiation of
                    <lb/>sin, there was, 1st atonement. 2nd pardon. and 3rd Blessing. Now we know, that there 
                    <lb/>can be no effectual groundwork of pardon, or blessing, that is not laid in his atonement,
                    <lb/>for vindication on the ground of innocent intention, is, we have seen, utterly out of 
                    <lb/>the question, much less then on account of innocence. Let us not then say in our hearts,
                    <lb/>we have injured no man, we have defrounded no man, we believe in <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, we have nothing to
                    <lb/>fear. The priest did not - do this, he did not advance one step without sacrifice, he
                    <lb/>ackknowledges &#x0026; atones for guilt, but he does not plead innocence, for, had he 
                    <lb/>done so, he would have been departing from the plan which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> has universally laid down
                    <lb/>of salvation.</p>
                    <p>Let us then finally remember, that <persName corresp="#LORD">Christ</persName> is at present our high priest and that he has
                    <lb/>done more than the priest of the Jews, inasmuch, as besides offering the atonement which
                    <lb/>he has made with his own blood, he has also met the punishment, allotted to our sin and 
                    <lb/>presents us with the assurance that our <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> is one, who will be always gracious</p> <!--Cannot tell if gracious is the correct word in the manuscript-->
