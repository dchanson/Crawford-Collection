                            <lb/>when on the other hand, we find a di&#45;

                            <lb/>it is as strong a confirmation of the

                            <lb/>between purity and impurity. We
                            <lb/>see this in society every day. The
                            <lb/>worthy and the vile are respectively
                            <lb/>shunned by each other, they are,

                            <lb/>but men of character associate with
                            <lb/>men of character, and those who are
                            <lb/>destitute of character, with those who
                            <lb/>resemble them. And thus it is in

                            <lb/>such, and this therefore we find to

                            <lb/>the particular details of conduct. the <!-- period after "conduct" should probably be a comma, and "the" a scratch-out? -->
                            <lb/>which we find was commanded
                            <lb/>to be observed in this chapter. The

                            <lb/>This is remarkable, we find that
                            <lb/>the first commandment was one
                            <lb/>which must be enforced on child&#45;
                            <lb/>hood itself, and that on the very ear

                            <lb/>powers of the child. This holy puri<!-- gloss from text file probably correct, but there is an extraneous letter or mark after the "i" in purity -->
                            <lb/>ty was to be enforced on old age, and
                            <lb/>infancy, and the code of commands here
                            <lb/>commences with that very first of
                            <lb/>all duties, which was to be observ

                            <lb/>The first opportunity was to be seiz
                            <lb/>ed and then that state of purity was <!-- word "was" is obscurely written here, but "was" fits and is consistent with hand -->
                            <lb/>to commence, which was to be con
                            <lb/>tinued to the end of life. Now, it is to
                            <lb/> be remarked, that there was no gen
                            <lb/>eral principle or law of this kind, a
                            <lb/>mong the heathens. There was no
                            <lb/>enforement of filial piety, I do not
                            <lb/>mean to say that it was never
                            <lb/>practised, it was so frequently <hi><del>on the</del></hi>

                            <lb/>very fine examples of it could be ad
                            <lb/>duced from ancient history, I only
                            <lb/>mean to say, that the neglect of it
                            <lb/>though always considered culpable,
                            <lb/>was not punishable, there was no law
                            <lb/>which commanded it observance.
                            <lb/>Now, in this case, fear must not

                             <lb/>first glance, entirely distinct, but this
                             <lb/>is not the case, when we examine in&#45;
                             <lb/>to their nature, we shall find a very
                             <lb/>great similarity, such indeed as not
                             <lb/> only permits, but requires, an as&#45;
                             <lb/>sociation between them. In the first
                             <lb/>place, children are to be taught to rev&#45;
                             <lb/>erence their earthly parents, must they
                             <lb/>not then much more be taught 
                             <lb/>to reverence their heavenly parent. No
                             <lb/>thing can be easier, than to lead the
                             <lb/>mind of the child from one to the o
                             <lb/>ther, it is an easy and regular tran&#45;
                             <lb/>sition, and fellowship will be found
                             <lb/>between the feelings of duty to the
                             <lb/>parent, and of duty towards god.
                             <lb/>Then when the child is taught that
                             <lb/>he has two fathers, both of which
                             <lb/>he must constantly render duty to
                             <lb/>the observance of the Sabbath is an
                             <lb/>apt, and familiar illustration of the
                             <lb/>duty which god requires of them
                             <lb/>Thus we see that these two prec&#45;
                             <lb/>epts go hand in hand, and that
                             <lb/>they are the first, the easiest, yet the
                             <lb/>most important, which can be im
                             <lb/>pressed upon the mind of the child. &#38;
                             <lb/>We see that there is a reason here also
                             <lb/>given for this demand, For, because,
                             <lb/>I am the Lord your god. I am not
                             <lb/>a despotic and tyrannical monarch
                             <lb/>who forms laws merely for that

                             <lb/>into that land which I promised to

                             <lb/>should render duty to me, and teach
                             <lb/>your children also, that they may
                             <lb/>love me, and obey me, and keep my
