                    <lb/>ration.  I have read these words, in
                    <lb/>order, that through them, I may be
                    <lb/>enabled to make some general rem
                    <lb/>arks, on the lives, the habits and the
                    <lb/>acts of the patriarchs, and these most
                    <lb/>certainly require attention, in order, to
                    <lb/>discover the amount of the privileges,
                    <lb/>which they enjoyed, and also, the uses,
                    <lb/>which they made of those privileges
                    <lb/>Now, the whole family of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, had
                    <lb/>formerly, and have now, clear statement,
                    <lb/>and evidences, capable of proving the per
                    <lb/>fect truth of those statements, but they
                    <lb/>neither had, nor have, such a clear,
                    <lb/>and certain application of the gospel, to
                    <lb/>individuals, as may be capable, of&#x2014;at
                    <lb/>once affording them assurance of their

                    <lb/>security, consequent upon that assur&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ance.  Let us therefore consider, how.
                    <lb/>for the pledges and promises (of the
                    <lb/>truth of which no doubt could possib
                    <lb/>ly be entertained, inasmuch as this was
                    <lb/>a period, in which visions, and direct
                    <lb/>communications with <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, were, by
                    <lb/>no means uncommon) were, in fact
                    <lb/>redeemed to the ancient Patriarchs, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>in pursuance of this design, I should
                    <lb/>wish first to make a few remarks, upon
                    <lb/>the character of the blessings.  And we
                    <lb/>shall therefore refer to the twenty sixth
                    <lb/>Chapter of <title type="scripture" corresp="#GENESIS">Genesis</title>, in which at the third
                    <lb/>verse, we find the blessing pronounced by
                    <lb/>the <persName corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> upon <persName corresp="#ISAAC">Isaac</persName>,.&#x201D;<!--or is it supposed to be: "&#x201C;"-->  Sojourn in this
                    <lb/>land, and I will be with thee, and will
                    <lb/>bless thee, for unto thee and to thy seed
                    <lb/>I will give all these countries and I
                    <lb/>will perform the oath which I swore
                    <lb/>unto <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> thy father, &#x0026;c. &#x2014;  We
                    <lb/>find, that this blessing was essen
                    <lb/>tially the same with that at first pro
                    <lb/>nounced upon <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, and which
                    <lb/>was transferred from father to son.
                    <lb/>by <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> himself.  It was again trans
                    <lb/>ferred from <persName corresp="#ISAAC">Isaac</persName> to <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName>, twenty&#x2010;se
                    <lb/>venth, chapter, 27 verse,  But still, there
                    <lb/>remains a very great indistinctness, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>generality, in the stating of all these
                    <lb/>blessings, which were transferred from
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#Abraham">Abraham</persName> to <persName corresp="#ISAAC">Isaac</persName>, and from <persName corresp="#ISAAC">Isaac</persName>,
                    <lb/>to <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName>,  They are remarkable,  be&#x2010;
                    <lb/>cause they combine such a remarka
                    <lb/>ble degree of certainty, with so much
                    <lb/>generality.  They were so vague as to 
                    <lb/>leave ample reason for the patriarchs
                    <lb/>to exercise there faith and there was
                    <lb/>sufficient and certain evidence to af
                    <lb/>ford ground for that faith.  But when
                    <lb/>the faith however strong it might
                    <lb/>be, was only extended to the truth
                    <lb/>of the promises, and not to their ap
                    <lb/>preciation, it gave room for very great
                    <lb/>errors, as in the instance of <persName corresp="#ESAU">Esau</persName> and
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName>.  <persName corresp="#ESAU">Esau</persName> was the elder, and <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName>
                    <lb/>the younger, but <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName> was the favou

                    <lb/>rite of his mother, and the practised fraud
                    <lb/>to obtain for him a blessing of which, althoug<!--h?-->
                    <lb/>she knew the certain and positive truth
                    <lb/>yet the personal application of which
                    <lb/>she knew not.  We have however, many
                    <lb/>instances of the same feeling, throughout
                    <lb/>all the lives of the patriarchs, occasioned
                    <lb/>by this imperfect kind of faith, but this
                    <lb/>does not atall, excuse the proceeding.  At
                    <lb/>the present time, we know the certainty 
                    <lb/>of salvation through <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> the certain 
                    <lb/>ty of general salvation is attested by suf
                    <lb/>ficient evidence, but still, it is dif
                    <lb/>ficult to apply it personally, to bring
                    <lb/>it home to ourselves, there we have 
                    <lb/>doubts, and fears, and faulterings, we be
                    <lb/>lieve, but we cannot apply, and we know
                    <lb/>but we cannot trust, It is this, which 
                    <lb/>causes us now, not to be sufficiently attach
                    <lb/>ed to the word of God, we hear of the word<!--???--> kingdom of 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and we believe in its truth, and yet
                    <lb/>we will not exert ourselves in order to ob
                    <lb/>tain it.  I call your, own experience to
                    <lb/>witness that this is the fact although it 
                    <lb/>might <del rend="strikethrough">als</del> be inferred <del rend="strikethrough">fr</del> merely from the 
                    <lb/>nature of the human mind.  Let us es
                    <lb/>cape as much as possible from this kind of
                    <lb/>feeling which so frequently influenced the
                    <lb/>actions of the patriarchs, and let us en
                    <lb/>deavour to imitate their settled habits, not
                    <lb/>the incidental actions, which sometimes were
                    <lb/>contrary to those habits  But it may be
                    <lb/>asked if this state of mind exists now, 
                    <lb/>how can we escape from sin.  Now, the
                    <lb/>promises say. the blood of <persName corresp="#JESUSCHRIST">Christ</persName> cleanseth 
                    <lb/>from all sin, and our only inquiry must
                    <lb/>be,  Have we accepted this blood, For the
                    <lb/>doubting state of mind must all be traced
                    <lb/>to unbelief  There must be some doubt of 
                    <lb/>the testimony of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, if we cannot make
                    <lb/>it ours.  There cannot be entire belief in the
                    <lb/>truth combined, with want of faith in per
                    <lb/>sonal application  But if, in some cases;
                    <lb/>we find this state of mind on the part 
                    <lb/>of the patriarchs, let us observe the particu
                    <lb/>lars of <del rend="strikethrough">part</del> some of the actions occaison
                    <lb/>ed by that doubt.  <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName> was instruc&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ted to practise fraud, in order to obtain
                    <lb/>the blessing of a <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> who was altogether ho
                    <lb/>ly and just, <persName corresp="#REBEKAH">Rebecca</persName> must, have had a
                    <lb/>strange idea of the blessing of <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, to sup
                    <lb/>pose that it was to be obtained in this 
                    <lb/>manner, We must suppose that she was
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Recto_4"/>
                    <lb/>either altogether ignorant of the attribut
                    <lb/>es of the <persName corresp="#GOD">God</persName> whose blessing she thus
                    <lb/>endeavoured to obtain, or else, that she 
                    <lb/>had at the time entirely forgotten them
                    <lb/>We would bring this before you, in order
                    <lb/>to show how persons may be led away 
                    <lb/>by their own views.  Can we say, that
                    <lb/>there is nothing done among us at the
                    <lb/>present day, which resembles this action
                    <lb/>of <persName corresp="#REBEKAH">Rebecca</persName>s.  <del rend="strikethrough">These d</del> In these days, as
                    <lb/>we have before said <del rend="strikethrough">?</del> men were freq

                    <lb/><persName corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName>, yet this did not <del rend="strikethough">hinder</del> pre
                    <lb/>vent these actions from taking place. &#x0026;,
                    <lb/>in the same way although we have seen
                    <lb/>the fulfilment of the promises yet this
                    <lb/>cannot prevent similar feelings.  I will not
                    <lb/>say what they may be, every one must&#x2010;
                    <lb/>know that within himself, And we see
                    <lb/>that although the fraud might be said to
                    <lb/>have obtained a partial blessing, yet it was
                    <lb/>attended with infinite misery, one torment
                    <lb/>ing circumstance succeeded another, and 
                    <lb/>at the end of his life he was obliged to
                    <lb/>confess, that &#x201C;Few and evil have been the
                    <lb/>days of my pilgrimage.  I am afraid that
                    <lb/>many parents at the present day, fol
                    <lb/>low the example of <persName corresp="#REBEKAH">Rebecca</persName> in endeavou

                    <lb/>of their children, that for the future ben

                    <lb/><p>Again.  We cannot dwell upon all the 
                    <lb/>circumstances of the life of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, but it
                    <lb/>affords a sufficient number of instances of 
                    <lb/>the same feeling, We find in the first place
                    <lb/>providence permitting him to be carried in
                    <lb/>to <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, in order <del rend="strikethrough">that</del> to promote his fu
                    <lb/>ture good and then the famine compell&#x2010;
                    <lb/>ing his brethren, to go up into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> for corn
                    <lb/>and we must next consider what influ
                    <lb/>enced the conduct of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> toward his
                    <lb/>brethren, (neither excusing their wickedness,
                    <lb/>nor forgetting to distinguish the acts of Jo
                    <lb/>seph, from his habits) In the first place
                    <lb/>5 verse. of XLII chapter of <title type="scripture" corresp="#GENESIS">Genesis</title>, we are 
                    <lb/>told that <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> knew his brethren but
                    <lb/>they knew not him. and this may be
                    <lb/>easily accounted for if we consider, that
                    <lb/>when <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> was last seen by his 
                    <lb/>brethren, he was but a youth, and in

                    <lb/>consequence may be supposed to have alter
                    <lb/>ed much more, during the period of at least
                    <lb/>seven years which must since have elapsed &#x0026; 
                    <lb/>also the circumstance of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>Joseph were so com
                    <lb/>pletely altered as to render it difficult for
                    <lb/>his brethren to recognise him, while theirs
                    <lb/>remained exactly the same, But we find
                    <lb/>that although <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> recognised them at 
                    <lb/>once, yet he said that they were spies,
                    <lb/>and then adopts a test, swearing, by the 
                    <lb/>life of Pharaoh<!--does this need a persName tag?-->, a profane and idolatrous
                    <lb/>oath that &#x201C;except your youngest brother 
                    <lb/>come hither ye shall not go forth hence
                    <lb/>Again, during a period of at least 
                    <lb/>9 years, although his father was within
                    <lb/>a very little distance, he made no inquiry
                    <lb/>after him, it was at least 9 years, for the 
                    <lb/>seven years of plenty had past away, and
                    <lb/>we find in the 6th verse of the 45 chapter
                    <lb/>For these two years hath the famine been
                    <lb/>in the land, Therefore without reckoning the 
                    <lb/>time which past between <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>s first be
                    <lb/>ing sold into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, and the commencement 
                    <lb/>of the years of plenty, and which may have
                    <lb/>been considerable, we find that during a 
                    <lb/>period of nine years he showed no anxiety
                    <lb/>about the welfare of his father and made 
                    <lb/>no inquiry after him. we might have
                    <lb/>expected that as soon as the famine com&#x2010;
                    <lb/>menced, he would <del rend="strikethrough">have</del> at least then
                    <lb/>have informed his father of his prosper
                    <lb/>ity and desired him to come to up into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> 
                    <lb/>in order that he might be able to assist 
                    <lb/>him, but we find him doing nothing 
                    <lb/>of the kind. This conduct was not worthy 
                    <lb/>of the rank to which he had attained al
                    <lb/>though it was most likely this elevation 
                    <lb/>which affected his principles and caused
                    <lb/>him to act in this manner.  I know  
                    <lb/>that the history of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> has been com&#x2010;
                    <lb/>monly held up in quite a different 
                    <lb/>light, It has been considered as an entertain
                    <lb/>ing tale, and an excellent example, while,
                    <lb/>on the contrary, the view which I have 
                    <lb/>taken <del rend="strikethrough">Joseph</del> of this subject appears to 
                    <lb/>bring down his actions from ideal to real,
                    <lb/>and to the common level of human nat
                    <lb/>ure. and we find that the effect which 
                    <lb/>it produced on his brothers was the same 
                    <lb/>as that with which it has struck me
                    <lb/>(5 verse of 50 chapter) And when <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>s
                    <lb/>brethren saw that their father was dead they
                    <lb/>said &#x201C;<persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> will peradventure hate us and
                    <lb/>will certainly requite us all the evil which
                    <lb/>we did unto him; They were more.
                    <lb/>struck with the incident than with

                    <lb/>the habits, which was probably caused by their
                    <lb/>being as soon as they came into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, sent
                    <lb/>into the Land of <placeName corresp="#GOSHEN">Goshen</placeName> were being at some
                    <lb/>distance from the court they could not
                    <lb/>have an opportunity of witnessing the hab
                    <lb/>its of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>.  The impression on <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName> was, 
                    <lb/>we find, the same,.  Now I do not say this,
                    <lb/>in order to blot a character in other cir&#x2010;
                    <lb/>cumstances so fair, but in order to be enabled
                    <lb/>to derive benefit from it. Let us always 
                    <lb/>flee from pride with abhorrence. Pride
                    <lb/>was <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>s bane, How much more con-
                    <lb/>sistent would it have been, had he sent
                    <lb/>to his fathers home, and communicated. 
                    <lb/>with him, informed him of his prosperity
                    <lb/>and invited him to share it.  But no, on 
                    <lb/>the contrary he adopted the practises of the
                    <lb/>Pagan court in ee<!--??--> which he was, and instead
                    <lb/>of producing any thing like the object which
                    <lb/>I think erroneously he is said to have
                    <lb/>had in view, namely to <del rend="strikethrough">com</del> soften his
                    <lb/>brethren and cause them to repent, he only
                    <lb/>made them fear him. And, had <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>
                    <lb/>previously been told of the conduct which
                    <lb/>he afterwards observed toward his breth
                    <lb/>ren he might have said like <persName corresp="#HAZAEL">Hazel</persName>
                    <lb/>to the <persName corresp="#ELISHA">prophet of Damascus</persName>, "Is thy ser

                    <lb/>not, I will not do this, or that, but 
                    <lb/>let us cast ourselves entirely on the will

                    <lb/>is so constantly and steadily held forth
