                    <lb/>ted to us, for when we take the church

                    <lb/>ing from strength to strength, daily &#x0026; 
                    <lb/>rapidly increasing among in the midst 
                    <lb/>of all endeavours to suppress it, we un
                    <lb/>derstand more of its institutions, and of 
                    <lb/>the Providence which brought it up 
                    <lb/>than we could possibly do, if we on
                    <lb/>ly considered it in its present ma

                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Verso_5.jpg"/>
                    <lb/>We must first, in order fully to under
                    <lb/>stand this subject, remember the condit
                    <lb/>ion of the Israelites, before <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>&#x02BC;s death 
                    <lb/>We are told, that when <persName corresp="#JACOB">Jacob</persName>, and his 
                    <lb/>family first came up into <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, they 
                    <lb/>had possessions in flocks and herds, they 
                    <lb/>had been shepherds from their youth, and 
                    <lb/>Pharaoh therefore, in requital of the ser
                    <lb/>vices of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, established them in the 
                    <lb/>land of <placeName corresp="#GOSHEN">Goshen</placeName>, because it was a fruit
                    <lb/>ful land, and fit for cattle. And there-
                    <lb/>fore, during the life of Pharoah, being un
                    <lb/>der the favour of the King, and placed 
                    <lb/>in an eligible situation, we may sup
                    <lb/>pose that they accumulated very much 
                    <lb/>wealth of this sort, and at the death of 
                    <lb/>Pharaoh. were in a most prosperous, &#x0026; 
                    <lb/>flourishing condition, till another king 
                    <lb/>arose, which knew not <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>. Now, 
                    <lb/>if we ask how the very numerous and 
                    <lb/>important services of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, could 
                    <lb/>be so soon forgotten, we would reply 
                    <lb/>that it can be accounted for in no 
                    <lb/>other way than by considering the na
                    <lb/>ture of human gratitude, Some, 
                    <lb/>affirm, that the new king was a 
                    <lb/>usurper, and feared the proximity of 
                    <lb/>the Israelites because they had now 
                    <lb/>become a very powerful people, and, ha
                    <lb/>ving experienced many benefits from 
                    <lb/>the former monarch, might perhaps 
                    <lb/>assist the native Egyptians, in depos
                    <lb/>ing him from the throne which he __. 
                    <lb/>But this is a mere supposition, de
                    <lb/>duced only from the kings forgetfulness of the. 
                    <lb/>many services of <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, we have 
                    <lb/>no evidence of th fact, but on the 
                    <lb/>contrary have very strong evidence 
                    <lb/>against it. for we are assured, in a 
                    <lb/>number of ancient historical re
                    <lb/>cords, that a disturbance, a revoluti
                    <lb/>on of this kind had taken place 
                    <lb/>before <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> was carried into <placeName corresp="EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> 
                    <lb/>very long before that time indeed, 
                    <lb/>and had retained the throne for a con
                    <lb/>siderable period, and also, that the sov
                    <lb/>reign who received <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, was in fact 
                    <lb/>the first of the native kings, who 
                    <lb/>was enabled to reassume the throne of 
                    <lb/>which his ancestors had been depriv&#x02BC;d 
                    <lb/>and we surely cannot suppose it to 
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Recto_6.jpg"/>
                    <lb/>be likely, that another revolution of the 
                    <lb/>same kind, should have taken place, 
                    <lb/>within a period so short. It is exceeding
                    <lb/>ly improbable that this king could have 
                    <lb/>been a usurper, and it is impossible, that 
                    <lb/>the expression &#x201C;knew not <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>&#x201D; can signify 
                    <lb/>that he was ignorant of the services he 
                    <lb/>had so publicly rendered to his prede
                    <lb/>cessor, and indeed to all the Egyptians, 
                    <lb/>The fame of one, who had not only fore
                    <lb/>told the coming of the seven years fam
                    <lb/>ine, but had preserved (most likely) a 
                    <lb/>very great part of a whole nation, 
                    <lb/>from death, or from ruin, must have, 
                    <lb/>been noised abroad long after that 
                    <lb/>person had ceased to exist, and <persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName> 
                    <lb/>was still living; In short, we can only 
                    <lb/>suppose, that this expression signifies, 
                    <lb/>not that the new king was ignorant 
                    <lb/>of the great and manifold services of 
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#JOSEPH">Joseph</persName>, but that he was resolved not 
                    <lb/>to reward them, he was jealous of a 
                    <lb/>people who were becoming excedingly 
                    <lb/>powerful, and who occupied, it may be 
                    <lb/>supposed, a very large portion of his 
                    <lb/>dominions. It is evident, that Phar
                    <lb/>aoh could have had no idea of the di
                    <lb/>vine economy, by which the children of 
                    <lb/><placeName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</placeName> were to be brought up out of 
                    <lb/><placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName>, and wander through many dangers 
                    <lb/>till at last they were to be established 
                    <lb/>in the land of promise, for, otherwise, he 
                    <lb/>could not have been jealous of a people 
                    <lb/>whose interference or <add place="above"><space quantity="22" unit="chars"/>or power</add> he could not then 
                    <lb/>have dreaded.</p>
                    <lb/><p>But, besides this jealousy, there was 
                    <lb/>another very devious reason why Phar
                    <lb/>aoh treated the children of <placeName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</placeName>, thus 
                    <lb/>hardly. The<del rend="strikethrough">r</del>y were settled in <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> for 
                    <lb/>their own advantage, not for, Pharaohs, 
                    <lb/>The king of <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> not only wished to 
                    <lb/>prevent the children of <placeName corresp="#ISRAEL">Israel</placeName> from ri
                    <lb/>sing against him, but to compel them 
                    <lb/>to labour for him, The advantages to 
                    <lb/>Pharaoh, which would be derived from 
                    <lb/>the united labour of a nation so nu
                    <lb/>merous, and so powerful, cannot but 
                    <lb/>have been considerable, it would enrich 
                    <lb/>his treasury, and it would increase his, 
                    <lb/>power. Now the expression &#x201C;Let us deal 
                    <lb/>wisely with them,&#x201D; signifies, I rather 
                    <lb/>think, let us deal cunningly with them 
                    <lb/>let us endeavour to turn their sojourn 
                    <lb/>in <placeName corresp="#EGYPT">Egypt</placeName> to our own advantage, for it 
                    <lb/>was not a thing wise in itself, to 
                    <lb/>oppress the Israelites, or deal tyrannically
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Verso_6.jpg"/>
                    <lb/>with them, on the contrary this would 
                    <lb/>provoke their hatred, and might have. 
                    <lb/>accelerated their rebellion.  In pursuance 
                    <lb/>therefore of this resolution, &#x201C;let us deal. 
                    <lb/>wisely or cunningly with them,&#x201D; we are 
                    <lb/>told that Pharoah set over them task 
                    <lb/>masters, in order to cause them to la
                    <lb/>bour constantly, and to secure their 
                    <lb/>labour for himself, And they built 
                    <lb/>treasure cities, <persName corresp="#PITHON">Pithon</persName>, and <persName corresp="#RAMESSES">Rameses</persName>, Now

                    <lb/>it is more probable that they were emp

                    <lb/>be the nature of te labour of 
                    <lb/>The Israelites, and thus the bondage

                    <lb/>they were prone to return to the idola

                    <lb/><p>We should however, also notice, the char

                    <lb/>and we well know, how base and 
                    <lb/>vile that mythology was. If then

                    <lb/>Providence ruleth over the darkness, as 
                    <lb/>well as over the light. If we could, on 
                    <lb/>all occasions, look beyond our afflictions 
                    <lb/>and endeavour to scrutinize the purpos
                    <lb/>es of them. we should feel ourselves equa<!--l?-->
                    <lb/>ly secure under adversity or prosperity  
                    <lb/>Again. we see from this the import
                    <lb/>ance of decision of character. Had the 
                    <lb/>Israelites only been possessed of this - 
                    <lb/>they would not so soon have submit
                    <lb/>ted to the influence of Idolary, they would
                    <lb/>not so soon have forsaken their own <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>and bowed down to Idols, had it not 
                    <lb/>been for their indecision this it was that 
                    <lb/>permitted such an invasion of their 
                    <lb/>sacred character, And <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> permitted
                    <lb/>the visitation on account of this. And 
                    <lb/>if there were not in us such a decis
                    <lb/>ion of character, as would enable us to 
                    <lb/>hold to the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> under any adversity
                    <lb/>or Affliction the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Lord</persName> will cause it by
                    <lb/>trails. Remember who said, "he that 
                    <lb/>is not for me, is against me, if we 
                    <lb/>are not instant enough and eager e
                    <lb/>nough and constant enough, in follow
                    <lb/>ing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> it is as bad as being his enemy
                    <lb/>or worshipping beasts and birds and idols
                    <pb facs="Ruskin_MA_3451_296806_Recto_9.jpg"/> 
                    <lb/>Lastly, we should observe the judgement 
                    <lb/>that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> will finally pronounce on all
                    <lb/>his enemies. Here was a mighty mon
                    <lb/>arch, and a mighty people, but they strove 
                    <lb/>against <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and warred upon his peo
                    <lb/>ple, and were overwhelmed in the very 
                    <lb/>flush of victory. Woe unto him that 
                    <lb/>striveth with his maker. Oh <!--?--> let us 
                    <lb/>flee from the wrath to come, and from 
                    <lb/>the punishment which will fall upon 
                    <lb/>headstrong rebellion, and let us trust 
                    <lb/>ourselves to that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> who has thus al
                    <lb/>ways watched over the welface of his 
                    <lb/>own people, as knowing, that he is a 
                    <lb/>kind and faithful <persName type="fictional" corresp="#Creator">God</persName>.</p>
