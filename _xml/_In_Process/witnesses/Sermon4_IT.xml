                    <p>1st to 3rd verse. XII. We must fix our attention
                    <lb/>to day, in the first place, upon the various dis
                    <lb/>pensations, which have been, both before, and af
                    <lb/>ter the flood, held forth to man, as the means
                    <lb/>of his salvation. The first of these dispensa
                    <lb/>tions, was that before the fall, which was en
                    <lb/>tire perfection in the creature, and power to
                    <lb/>obtain his own salavation, in consequence
                    <lb/>of which, a proportionate demand was made
                    <lb/>upon him, of perfect obedience, by his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>.
                    <lb/>But this perfection was lost, and the
                    <lb/>power of obtaining salvation by that dispen
                    <lb/>sation, was at an end. Then there came a
                    <lb/>change, but it is to be observed, that it
                    <lb/>was only a change of the creature, not of
                    <lb/>the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> made the same demands
                    <lb/>upon man, but another mode was ordain
                    <lb/>ed to him, of fulfilling them; The <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>
                    <lb/>was, and is, the same, under every
                    <lb/>change and every dispensation and these
                    <lb/>various changes were only different modes
                    <lb/>of showing his glory, his justice, and his
                    <lb/>soverignty, Now, we must bear in mind
                    <lb/>that the dispensation after was quite uni
                    <lb/>versal in its character, the promise of sal
                    <lb/>vation was equally extended to all the hu
                    <lb/>man race, it shut out none, and there
                    <lb/>was no benefit given to one individual,
                    <lb/>which was not attainable by all, it was
                    <lb/>universal in efficacy, although it was not
                    <lb/>so in facts, and it would also have been
                    <lb/>on account of sin.</p>
                    <p>But this universality is now lost, in the
                    <lb/>administration to <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>. A particular
                    <lb/>nation is selected descending from a single
                    <lb/>individual; But we should observe, that al
                    <pb facs="296805v_0019"/>
                    <lb/>though, this particular administration, is
                    <lb/>limited, the former one is still continued
                    <lb/>and still extending its benefits to all men,
                    <lb/>it is an addition, not  limitation, it is
                    <lb/>introduced into the former economy, with
                    <lb/>out destroying it. And we have several
                    <lb/>proofs of this. For under what dispensa
                    <lb/>tion can we suppose what <persName corresp="#MELCHISEDEK">Melchisedek</persName> was
                    <lb/>a high preist, Certainly under the first, and
                    <lb/>not under the Abrahamic We may now
                    <lb/>enter into the particulars of the calling of
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>. 31st verse, 11. It may be as
                    <lb/>ked, how <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, as it is here told us
                    <lb/>departed, with his family, from <placeName corresp="#UR">Ur of Chaldees</placeName>,
                    <lb/>apparently before he was called by
                    <lb/><persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>. But, I think it is evident that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>had appeared to him before he left <persName corresp="#HUR">Hur</persName> and
                    <lb/>arrived in <placeName corresp="#HARAN">Haran</placeName>. For, there is no doubt
                    <lb/>that the beginning of the twelfth chapter
                    <lb/>goes back to events which had happened
                    <lb/>previously to his departure from <placeName corresp="#UR">Ur</placeName>.
                    <lb/>Let us look at the seventh chapter of <title type="scripture" corresp="#ACTS">Acts</title>,
                    <lb/>and the 2nd verse. <persName corresp="#STEPHEN">Stephen</persName> says, "The <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>of Glory appeared unto our father <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>
                    <lb/>when he was in <placeName corresp="#MESOPOTAMIA">Mesopotamia</placeName>, before he dwelt
                    <lb/>in <placeName corresp="#HARAN">Charran</placeName>, which is <placeName corresp="#HARAN">Haran</placeName> , according
                    <lb/>to the Greek pronunciation" and said un
                    <lb/>to him Get thee out of thy country,
                    <lb/>and from thy kindered and come into the land
                    <lb/>which I shall show thee For taking the
                    <lb/>order of the words in <title type="book" corresp="#BIBLE">Genesis</title>, we should i 
                    <lb/>magine, that <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> was called after
                    <lb/>he had dwelt in <placeName corresp="#HARAN">Haran</placeName>, or <placeName corresp="#HARAN">Charran</placeName>, but we
                    <lb/>may be sure, that <persName corresp="#STEPHEN">Stephen</persName> and <persName corresp="#MOSES">Moses</persName> were
                    <lb/>in perfect unison, and that, as <persName corresp="#MOSES">Moses</persName> says
                    <lb/>"the <persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> had said to Abram," the seeming <!-- is he referring to Abraham here?-->
                    <lb/>contradiction is only from the transposi
                    <lb/>tion of the words</p>
                    <p>We may next consider the situation of
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> and his family his religious views
                    <lb/>, and condition, before he was called, in or
                    <lb/>der to preserve the worship of the True <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>,
                    <lb/>who was, at this period, almost entirely
                    <lb/>forgotten, amid the depravity and idolatry
                    <lb/>so generally prevailing, prevailing so com
                    <lb/>pletely indeed, that we have authority
                    <lb/>for supposing that there were idols, even
                    <pb facs="296805_0020"/>
                    <lb/>even in <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abrahams</persName> own family; Now, if
                    <lb/>this state of things had continued for a very
                    <lb/>small time longer, the earth would have been
                    <lb/>left without one single testimony of even the
                    <lb/>existence of the true <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>. It was therefor nec
                    <lb/>essary, immediately to bring <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> away
                    <lb/>from his house, and from his kindered, and to
                    <lb/>wean him from the worship of the Idols, which
                    <lb/>were placed even in his own house. For, we
                    <lb/>read in the twenty fourth chapter of <persName corresp="#JOSHUA">Joshua</persName>, and
                    <lb/>the second verse, "Your fathers dwelt on the other
                    <lb/>side of the flood in old time, (that is, on the other
                    <lb/>side of the river <geogName corresp="#EUPHRATES">Euphrates</geogName>; which was called the
                    <lb/>flood, because it was the largest river then
                    <lb/>known; and not meaning the deluge) even <persName corresp="#TERAH">Terah</persName>,
                    <lb/>the father of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> and the father of
                    <lb/>Nahor, and they served other <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Gods</persName>," it is distinct
                    <lb/>ly stated that they were Idolaters, and al
                    <lb/>though it does not positively affirm, that
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> himself was a worshipper of idols
                    <lb/>, yet, I think we may suppose him to have
                    <lb/>been so, before he was called of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and his
                    <lb/>future blessings announced to him.</p>
                    <p>In these blessings, there are a few particulars
                    <lb/>which may be severally noticed. There is,
                    <lb/>first, a simple promise made to <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>
                    <lb/>that the <persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> will shew him a land, there
                    <lb/>is nothing more, there is no imitation
                    <lb/>given as to its character, its name, or its po
                    <lb/>sition, it is not said whether it shall be
                    <lb/>barren, or fruitful, large, or small, desert
                    <lb/>or inhabited. He is left to exercise his
                    <lb/>faith, he must leave his house, his coun
                    <lb/>try, his kindred, and he must trust all
                    <lb/>his interests in the hands of his <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>.
                    <lb/>This however, he does, and what without a
                    <lb/>moments hesitation, as the <persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> had spo
                    <lb/>ken unto him, and his instant and willing
                    <lb/>compliance presents us with an example
                    <lb/>of what our conduct ought invariably
                    <lb/>to be, with regard to the promises of
                    <lb/><persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>. But how much, how con
                    <lb/>stantly we deviate from the rule of con
                    <lb/>duct which the patriarch has, in this
                    <lb/>instance, so strictly observed. How daily,
                    <lb/>how hourly, are we wishing, and even
                    <lb/>stipulating to the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName> to under
                    <lb/>stand the entire bearing of everything
                    <lb/>which is written in <title type="book" corresp="#BIBLE">Scripture</title>, <!--How to tag books?-->
                    <pb facs="296805v_0021"/>
                    <lb/>When we ought, without a moments hes
                    <lb/>itation, to trust ourselves, and our con
                    <lb/>cerns wholly to the keeping, and man
                    <lb/>agement, of a true, kind, and a faith
                    <lb/>ful <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>, we are as suspicious
                    <lb/>as if we were moving in the country
                    <lb/>of an artful, and vigilant enemy, and
                    <lb/>where an ambush was laid for us in every
                    <lb/>thicket. How different how exceedingly
                    <lb/>different, was the spirit of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>. He
                    <lb/>knew only, but he knew that certainly
                    <lb/>that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> had spoken, and that the
                    <lb/>path which he had to follow, was in
                    <lb/>stant and unhesitating confidence, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>he therefore waits for nothing more. If
                    <lb/>we were to follow his example, and, ha

                    <lb/>and completely fulfilled, will believe
                    <lb/>that those which are yet obscure to us,
                    <lb/>shall, in time, be discovered to be e

                    <lb/>travel on fearlessly, with such a

                    <lb/>trusting in the faith of our <persName type="fictional" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>, to
                    <lb/>relieve our minds from all worldly f

                    <lb/>very few promises indeed had been made
                    <lb/>to <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, in comparison of the num

                    <lb/>that, of those few, none had been hither
                    <lb/>to fulfilled, that he saw those prophe

                    <lb/>ing light, which are seen by us under

                    <lb/>us then who rise so far above in the

                    <lb/>the readiness of our faith.</p>
                    <p>The next article of this promise, is, that
                    <lb/>the <persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> will make of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> a great
                    <lb/>nation, showing, what we have men
                    <lb/>tioned before, that the Abrahamic dis
                    <lb/>pensation was limited to a peculiar
                    <lb/>nation, the descendants of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, al
                    <lb/>though it shut out no one from
                    <lb/>the previous administrations.
                    <pb facs="296805v_0022"/>
                    <lb/>There is the same want of perspicuity in
                    <lb/>this promise <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> is not told when
                    <lb/>or where, or how, or under what circum
                    <lb/>stances the <persName corresp="#LORD">Lord</persName> will make him a great
                    <lb/>nation, and <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abrahams</persName> faith is again put
                    <lb/>to the test, but it fails not The verse
                    <lb/>goes on I will bless thee. Now, we should
                    <lb/>remark here, that to be made a great
                    <lb/>nation alone might, or might not be a
                    <lb/>blessing, most probably might on the
                    <lb/>contrary prove a curse, for wealth, power,
                    <lb/>glory, any, or all of the good things of this
                    <lb/>world, only can prove blessings, when they
                    <lb/>are accomplished by the blessing of the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Almighty</persName>,
                    <lb/> and it is therefore, this blessing,
                    <lb/>which constitutes what is really good
                    <lb/>or desireable, in every thing. We might
                    <lb/>suppose kingdoms and rulers and nations
                    <lb/>to be submitted to <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, or forces,
                    <lb/>and wealth and power, and dominion, to
                    <lb/>be given unto him, but if we suppose
                    <lb/>him alone possessed of infinitely
                    <lb/>more than all these, and beyond the
                    <lb/>power of man to injure him, while on the
                    <lb/>other hand, though he might be endowed
                    <lb/>with every good thing which earth
                    <lb/>could bestow upon him, if we suppose
                    <lb/>him void of divine grace, we suppose
                    <lb/>him unblest, with every blessing, and un
                    <lb/>happy with every happiness, while the pow
                    <lb/>er in which lay his pride, or the domin
                    <lb/>ion in which lay his power, might, in
                    <lb/>the end, only prove preludes to his fear
                    <lb/>ful and irrrevocable overthrow. It is
                    <lb/>only when the blessing of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> rests
                    <lb/>upon a man, that we can imagine
                    <lb/>him happy, or upon a nation, that
                    <lb/>we can imagine it great.</p>
                    <p>Again, it is promised to him, that his
                    <lb/>name shall be made great. Now, we
                    <lb/>are not to infer from this, that <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>
                    <lb/>desired a great name. On the contra
                    <lb/>ry had he desired it, it would most probably
                    <lb/>not have been granted him, because, we
                    <lb/> may be sure, that this was not to min
                    <lb/>ister to his pride, but to support his
                    <pb facs="296805v_0023"/>
                    <lb/>weakness. It was to encourage him in his
                    <lb/>humble simplicity, and in order that he might
                    <lb/>not yield to any despondency, which, other
                    <lb/>wise, might have overcome him, when he
                    <lb/>found himself in a strange land, where the
                    <lb/><persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> whom he served was not known, and far
                    <lb/>from his own his own country, his kin
                    <lb/>dred, his friends, and his family. The pro
                    <lb/>mise to make his name great, was to
                    <lb/>encourage his diffidence, and not to sup
                    <lb/>port his ambition.</p>
                    <p>The next promise, is, that he shall be
                    <lb/>a blessing. This is a very great, and im
                    <lb/>portant addition, to the former promise,
                    <lb/>that he should be blessed. For, had this
                    <lb/>only been granted him, his enjoyment
                    <lb/>would have been personal only, he would
                    <lb/>have stood alone, and his happiness would
                    <lb/>have been greatly cloyed, by seeing the
                    <lb/>misery, the vice, the violence, and the dep
                    <lb/>ravity with which he was surrounded.
                    <lb/>We cannot suppose one, who has attained
                    <lb/>a tall rock, in the middle of a tempes
                    <lb/>tuous ocean, and who sees his fellow&#x2010;be
                    <lb/>ings perishing around him to be hap
                    <lb/>py, although we may suppose him thank
                    <lb/>ful, and we cannot suppose, that <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>
                    <lb/>would have been supremely happy,
                    <lb/>although blest with all the good that
                    <lb/>earth or heaven could give, had that
                    <lb/>blessing been only personal: But, was it
                    <lb/>not a great encouragement to him, when
                    <lb/>he knew, that wherever he went, his pre
                    <lb/>sence should scatter blessings on every
                    <lb/>one around, that mirth should fol
                    <lb/>low his footsteps, and gladness accom
                    <lb/>pany his presence. This would se
                    <lb/>cure the blessings of all around him, en
                    <lb/>vy would not detract him, and malice
                    <lb/>would not injure him, his benevolence
                    <lb/>would be gratified, and his selfishness
                    <lb/>forgotten, or subdued. Now, it may
                    <lb/>be asked, if this circumstance, that <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>
                    <lb/>should be a blessing to all, was
                    <lb/>not inconsistent with, or contradic
                    <lb/>tory to, the limitation, the peculiar
                    <lb/>limitation, of the Abrahamic dipsen
                    <lb/>sation. We would answer No. For
                    <pb facs="296805v_0024"/>
                    <lb/>although, on account of the peculiar cir
                    <lb/>cumstances in which the patriarch was
                    <lb/>placed, he might be forced so far, to en
                    <lb/>ter into correspondence with the idolaters
                    <lb/>by whom he was surrounded, and although
                    <lb/>this correspondence might, in some de
                    <lb/>gree bring a blessing upon them, although
                    <lb/>he might, enter into traffic with them
                    <lb/>and buy and sell, (as we see from the 9th
                    <lb/>and following verses of the XXIII Chapter
                    <lb/>that he bought a cave, from <placeName corresp="#EPHRON">Ephron</placeName>, of
                    <lb/>the children, of <persName corresp="#HETH">Heth</persName>, for four hundreds
                    <lb/>shekels of silver) yet we cannot suppos
                    <lb/>that he was intimate with them. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/> had pointed out to him the path which
                    <lb/>he was to follow, and that was one of
                    <lb/>entire seclusion and seperation, from
                    <lb/>the rest of mankind, and it was his
                    <lb/>bounden duty, under all circumstances
                    <lb/>to stand aloof from all the worshippers
                    <lb/>of other <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">Gods</persName>, and to adhere to this se
                    <lb/>vere rule so strictly, as even to with
                    <lb/>draw himself from his own family, &#x0026;
                    <lb/>friends, when these went after unknown
                    <lb/>gods, in short, all, that the smallest de
                    <lb/>gree would interpose between him, and
                    <lb/>the <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> whose servant he had been
                    <lb/>appointed, must be entirely set aside.
                    <lb/>And, let me say, that this should
                    <lb/>be our line of conduct at the present
                    <lb/>day, we should stand aloof from every

                    <lb/>share in their ruin. Lot did not ad
                    <lb/>here strictly to this rul, but entered in

                    <lb/>was overtaken by the same destruction

                    <lb/>we have to do with the things of this

                    <p>Again, the verse goes on, to say that <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>
                    <lb/>not only will bless the friends of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>
                    <lb/>but will set himself against his enemies
                    <lb/>Still, we observe that is exactly the line of
                    <lb/>enemies of his people may perhaps triumph
                    <lb/>on the earth, but their triumph will be
                    <lb/>but of short duration, and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName> will, in
                    <lb/>the latter end, bring them to a fearful
                    <lb/>account, for in all these things, we are
                    <lb/>more than conquerors. Even on the ear
                    <lb/>th, when he hath flourished for a little
                    <lb/>time like a flower of the field, and spread
                    <lb/>out his branches, like a green olive tree,
                    <lb/>by the rivers of waters, yet but a little
                    <lb/>while, and he passeth away, and the
                    <lb/>place thereof shall know it no more
                    <lb/>We have an example of this, in the battle
                    <lb/>of kings, in which we are told that
                    <lb/><persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, with three hundred and eigh
                    <lb/>teen men, defeated the forces of the five
                    <lb/>combined kings.
                    <lb/>We now come to the last, but the prin

                    <lb/>cipal, because in this part, the dispen

                    <lb/>one peculiar nation, is here extended
                    <lb/>to all the nations of the earth, "and in
                    <lb/>thee shall all families of the earth, be
                    <lb/>blessed. This part of the covenant, with
                    <lb/>out doubt, refers to <persName corresp="#LORD">Christ</persName>, who, being
                    <lb/>one ofthe descendants of <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName>, yet
                    <lb/>extends the Abrahamic dispensation,
                    <lb/>through his death, to the Jew, and the
                    <lb/>Gentile, to the bond and the free, to all,
                    <lb/>who will believe on him. Such were
                    <lb/>the various circumstances of the Abra

                    <lb/> believed, and was steady in that

                    <lb/>we still find thousands disbelieving
                    <lb/>this grand salvation Let me tell you
                    <lb/>that the rejection of the <title type="book" corresp="#BIBLE">Gospel</title>, or its
                    <lb/>neglect is a fearful and perilous crime. Let
                    <lb/>us not be found guilty of either. Let
                    <lb/>us receive it as <persName corresp="#ABRAHAM">Abraham</persName> did, and
                    <lb/>cast off every thing that can come be
                    <lb/>tween us and <persName type="fictional" corresp="#GOD">God</persName>, and may we be
                    <lb/>found, in the latter days among those
                    <lb/>families, who shall actually enjoy these
                    <lb/>most precious, and imperishable blessings.</p>
