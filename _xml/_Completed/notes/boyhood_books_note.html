            </header>
            <p>The aim of this note is not to provide an exhaustive listing of books that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> read or consulted in his youth. Information about <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs reading and its influences is available throughout <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, in the apparatuses and glosses of works containing specific allusions to and borrowings
               from publications to which he was exposed. Especially influential authors and published
               sources, moreover, are discussed in notes of their own. This information can be accessed
               using the archiveʼs Search. A portion of this note does attempt, however, to convey
               the scope of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs childhood and youthful reading through a descriptive (but not exhaustive) <a class="link_ref" href="#CHRONOLOGY" title="Chronology [under development]">Chronology</a> as well as to summarize <a class="link_ref" href="#APPROPRIATE_READING" title="The Ruskinsʼ Program of AgeAppropriate Reading">The Ruskinsʼ Program of Age‐Appropriate Reading for John</a>. These resources remain open to development.</p>
            <p>Among the main purposes of this note is to centralize some <a class="link_ref" href="#RESOURCES" title="Resources">Resources</a> for researching the Ruskin family reading during <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs youth by extending and enhancing existing research sources. Included are <a class="link_ref" href="#ANNUALLISTS" title="Annual Book Purchases 182745 as recorded by John James Ruskin in His Account Book">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="#DESCRIPTIONS" title="Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Boyhood and Youth">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Youth</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="#UNTRACED" title="Untraced Books">Untraced Books</a>. These resources build on the enumerative bibliographies compiled by <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span> in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a> (i.e., lists of annual book purchases drawn from <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book, RF MS 28 [<span class="date">1827–45</span>]</span></a>) and by <span class="persName">James S. Dearden</span> in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>. These published print sources remain the starting point for all investigations of
               the Ruskin family reading, whereas the lists here propose some additions and extensions.
               Not listed here are proposed corrections of specific entries in these print bibliographies.
               These corrections are found elsewhere in the archive in context of relevant evidence.</p>

               <h2><span class="headingNumber">1.1. </span><span class="head">On the Evidence of Ruskinʼs Reading in His Youth</span></h2>
               <p>As a preliminary to supplementing <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Dearden</span>ʼs bibliographies, some caveats merit discussion about what we are able to determine
                  about <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs reading in his youth.</p>
               <div class="subsection" id="PROVENANCE">
                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.1.1. </span><span class="head">Provenance</span></h3>
                  <p>Assuming that an item of childrenʼs literature can be traced to <span class="placeName">Brantwood</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs final home, its presence in his adult library is only a starting point for extending
                     the itemʼs provenance to <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span>, his boyhood home.  For example, among a <a class="link_ref" href="#BEINECKEBOOKS" title="Books held by the Beinecke Library Yale University">collection of books held by the <span class="placeName">Beinecke Library</span></a> supposed to have belonged to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in boyhood, there are two bound assemblages of separately published works, which
                     were acquired by the collector, <span class="persName">F. J. Sharp</span>. The responsibility for these bindings is unknown. While some of the individual items
                     contained therein bear marginalia recognizably in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs mature hand, the evidence for associating each of the items therein with his boyhood
                     is variable, in some cases amounting to little more than the publication date falling
                     within the relevant range. As an example of problematic items among the <span class="orgName">Beinecke</span> holdings, a copy of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> by <span class="persName">John Aikin</span> and <span class="persName">Anna Laetitia Barbauld</span>, which is undated on the title page, very likely is not the edition <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> used in boyhood. While a bookplate authenticates the copy as a <span class="placeName">Brantwood</span> book, and it contains some annotations in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs mature hand, other bibliographical details place its acquisition after his boyhood
                     absorption in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span>—perhaps long after (see <a class="link_ref" href="#EVENINGS" title="3"><span style="font-style:italic">Beinecke</span> no. 4</a>). As in any case for provenance, one can only weigh the evidence, and one purpose
                     of <a class="link_ref" href="#DESCRIPTIONS" title="Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Boyhood and Youth">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Boyhood and Youth</a> is to compile what is known.</p>
                  <p>A unique boon for tracing the provenance of books to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs boyhood and youth is the record of book and periodical purchases contained in <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs ledger of household accounts, the <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a>. These brief entries, which <span class="persName">John James</span> included under the heading “Sundries” for each year, and which he notated usually
                     with an identification of author and/or title along with the cost, are compiled by
                     <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span> in the <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, collected by year of acquisition and placed among the explanatory notes. <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs sketchy identifications include no publication details, and some entries can be
                     difficult even to distinguish as books from other kinds of “sundries”. <span class="persName">Burd</span> helpfully links some of <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs costs to prices in publisherʼs listings. The researcher should therefore start
                     with <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs annotated lists, while what is gathered in <a class="link_ref" href="#ANNUALLISTS" title="Annual Book Purchases 182745 as recorded by John James Ruskin in His Account Book">Lists of Annual Book Purchases by the Ruskin Family</a> are possible additional items found in the <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a>.</p>
                  <p>A limitation of the <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a> as an indicator of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early reading is that it begins in <span class="date">1827</span>, omitting records of book purchases prior to his eighth year. This was the period
                     when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents would have acquired many of the publications most commonly associated with
                     Romantic‐era and early Victorian writing for children, from fairy tales to moral and
                     scientific dialogues. The gap in the evidence of <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs accounts shifts all the more significance onto the provenance of physical books
                     alleged to have survived from <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs boyhood library.</p>
                  <p>Other sources of evidence about the familyʼs commerce in juvenile literature prior
                     to <span class="date">1827</span> (and afterward) are found in remarks about books in the family letters, along with
                     literary allusions detectable in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs juvenilia. While some of these allusions and passing references can be cross‐referenced
                     to bibliographical details known from another source or even to a physical copy, other
                     references in the letters reveal only a title, which is discussed as an <a class="link_ref" href="#UNTRACED" title="Untraced Books">Untraced Book</a>. For example, in a letter dated <span class="date">1823</span>, when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> was four years old, <span class="persName">Margaret</span> suggested books to <span class="persName">John James</span> that would make acceptable gifts for <span class="persName">John</span>: “if you bring any thing for him let it be <span class="titlem">the history of the children of the wood</span> or <span class="titlem">Sinbad the Sailor</span>—since he has been ill he has had so much medicine to take that I have been obliged
                     to buy I donʼt know how many books and you might perhaps bring him some he has already[.]
                     You can bring nothing he will be so well pleased with as a book” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span class="date">11 March 1823</span></span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Burd</span></a>, 126–27). Since no evidence survives attesting whether these books were ever acquired,
                     or, if purchased, in what edition, the titles are relegated to the list of <a class="link_ref" href="#UNTRACED" title="Untraced Books">Untraced Books</a> accompanied by discussion of the significance of that choice of text.</p>
                  <p>Another caveat concerning <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs purchases of books and other sundries recorded in his <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a> is that he rarely indicated the intended recipient. It is possible that some book
                     titles, especially of childrenʼs literature, may have been meant for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousins, particularly <a class="link_ref" href="richardson_mary_note.php"><span class="persName">Mary Richardson</span> (<span class="date">1815–49</span>)</a>, who lived with the Ruskin family from <span class="date">1828</span> until her marriage in <span class="date">1848</span>. While <span class="persName">Dearden</span> comments about the family library that “the books owned by all three Ruskins must
                     be considered to be part of ‘Ruskinʼs Library’ because he ultimately inherited his
                     parentsʼ possessions, as well as having the use of them during their lifetimes” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, xv, xxiv), one wonders how far the availability, much less the inheritance, extended
                     in the case of <span class="persName">Mary</span>ʼs books. To what extent did <span class="persName">John</span> and <span class="persName">Mary</span> share books? Similar speculation surrounds duplicate copies found in <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs accounts, such as his purchase of a <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Robinson Crusoe</span></span> in <span class="date">1835</span>, long after he presented <span class="persName">John</span> with an edition in <span class="date">1826</span> that cost two guineas (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 301 n. 12; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 91 [no. 694]). Alternatively, rather than indicating books purchased for others
                     outside the immediate family, duplicate titles might refer to additional, compact
                     editions to be taken on travels. Such usage would apply particularly to a work like
                     <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Robinson Crusoe</span></span>, which was deemed permissible reading on Sundays, and therefore counted as a necessary
                     travel item, just as <span class="persName">Margaret</span> packed a copy of <span class="persName">Bunyan</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Grace Abounding</span></span> for <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs first journey to <span class="placeName">Italy</span> without his parents, in <span class="date">1845</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RUSKININITALY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin in Italy</span></span>, ed. Bradley</a>, 000).</p>
                  <p>As a final caveat about provenance, evidence is incomplete about the respective influence
                     of <span class="persName">Margaret</span> and <span class="persName">John James</span> over the direction of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs reading. <span class="persName">John James</span> appears to have been the steadiest purchaser of books. As revealed by <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs comment quoted above from an <span class="date">1823</span> letter, however, <span class="persName">she</span> also was an occasional purchaser. The kinds of texts <span class="persName">Margaret</span> mentions were available as booklets with engravings for sixpence or a shilling, a
                     cost that presumably could be absorbed within her household budget. As one source
                     for recommended titles, she may have consulted the <a class="link_ref" href="evangelical_magazine_note.php"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evangelical Magazine</span></span></a> for lists of recently published childrenʼs books. These <span class="date">1823</span> book purchases occurred before <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs extant <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a> begins, but it is unclear whether any future purchases of books by <span class="persName">Margaret</span> would have been listed in <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs accounts. The annual lists of “Sundries” in the <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a>, which is the category where he placed book purchases, does not attribute specific
                     items to their buyers. While a different annual column, “House Expenses &amp; paid Mrs
                     R.”, is reserved for <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs purchases, these expenses are comprised solely of household staples. The miscellaneous
                     items comprised by “Sundries”, from dessert forks to <span class="persName">Walter Scott</span> novels, may have all been paid by <span class="persName">John James</span>, but it seems unlikely that he would have done all the shopping himself. Would <span class="persName">John James</span> have personally arranged, for example, for a “dress for my sister [<span class="persName">Janet Richardson</span>]” ()?</p>
                  <p>Examples of inexpensive publications aimed at young readers, which <span class="persName">Margaret</span> might have acquired, are included in <a class="link_ref" href="#FAIRYTALES" title="1"><span style="font-style:italic">Beinecke</span> no. 1</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="#WIDOW" title="2"><span style="font-style:italic">Beinecke</span> no. 2</a>. She may also have obtained some titles by loan rather than purchase (see <a class="link_ref" href="#OWN-BORROW" title="Loaned Books">Loaned Books</a>). By comparison with chapbook prices within reach of her household budget, <span class="persName">Margaret</span> sounds aghast at <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs “spending two guineas on” an edition of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Robinson Crusoe</span></span> for <span class="persName">John</span>. She wonders “what he [<span class="persName">John</span>] can do to make return” for such extravagance beyond making a “cave” which he had
                     “almost finished”—referring possibly to a physical project like “Robinson Crusoeʼs
                     island” undertaken by <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="persName">Frank</span> and his cousin <span class="persName">Mary</span>, which included appropriating the housekeeperʼs parrot (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem">Margaret Ruskin to John James Ruskin, <span class="date">25 May 1826</span></span>, in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Burd</span></a>, 149; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, 1:71–72; and for the edition of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Robinson Crusoe</span></span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 91 [no. 693]). While these examples suggest some differences of opinion between
                     <span class="persName">Margaret</span> and <span class="persName">John James</span> respecting the priorities they set for <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs reading,  the choice of books was a matter of earnestly shared discussion between
                     the couple, as when <span class="persName">Margaret</span> declared to her husband that it was time <span class="persName">John</span> be given <span class="persName">John Foxe</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Book of Martyrs</span></span>: “you shall hear all my reasons for wishing him to have it”, <span class="persName">Margaret</span> promised (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span class="date">15 May 1827</span></span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Burd</span></a>, 166).</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.1.2. </span><span class="head">Loaned Books</span></h3>
                  <p><span class="persName">Dearden</span> remarks that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in adulthood “was essentially . . . a book‐buyer rather than a book borrower or library
                     user” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, xix). This practice was inherited from his <span class="persName">father</span>, who was generous with purchases of books for his familyʼs education and entertainment.
                     Still, there is no way of knowing whether publications that left their influence on
                     the early writings were borrowed or owned, if otherwise unrecorded as part of the
                     family library in the <span class="date">1820s–30s</span>. For example, the poet <span class="persName">Felicia Hemans</span> was sufficiently admired for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> to have transcribed her poem, <a class="link_ref" href="hemanssoundofthesea_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Sound of the Sea”</span> (<span class="date">1826</span>)</a> in <span class="titlem">MS IVB</span>, probably based on the text as published in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">New Monthly Magazine</span></span>. He also adapted passages from <span class="persName">Hemans</span>ʼs long poem, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy</span></span>, published by <span class="orgName">Murray</span> in <span class="date">1816</span>, for use in his own poem, <a class="link_ref" href="saltzburg_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Saltzburg”</span></a>. Yet <span class="persName">Mrs. Hemans</span> is curiously absent from records of the Ruskinsʼ book ownership, apart from poems
                     included in literary annuals that the Ruskins are known to have owned. How publications
                     by <span class="persName">Hemans</span> passed through their hands—whether by purchase, borrowing, or casually encountering
                     a periodical—remains unknown.</p>
                  <p>Borrowing could have provided a means for <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> to control what books entered the house. She appears to refer to borrowing, for example,
                     when she writes to <span class="persName">John James</span> about the novel, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Fool of Quality</span></span> (<span class="date">1766–72</span>) by <span class="persName">Henry Brooke</span> (<span class="date">1703–83</span>). Since she “did not like” the novel, she “got the first volume merely to read the
                     History of the three little fishes to <span class="persName">John</span>”. In this instance, <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs renewed encounter with the novel led to “the Almighty open[ing] the understanding”
                     on her part, and she proposed to “read it together” with <span class="persName">John James</span>. Perhaps only then was the work purchased for the household, possibly in the abridged
                     form by <span class="persName">John Wesley</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1826-05-15_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">Margaret to John James Ruskin, 15 May 1826</span></a>, in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a> 145; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 51 [no. 336]; and see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#PEACEWESLEYSBROOKE"><span class="persName">Peace</span>, <span class="titlem">“Sentimentality in the Service of Methodism”</span></a>).</p>
                  <p>On travels, the Ruskins supplemented books they brought with them by tapping lending
                     resources along the way. During the tour of <span class="placeName">Switzerland</span> in <span class="date">1833</span>, for example, when <span class="persName">John</span> fell ill for a brief period, his father and his cousin <span class="persName">Mary</span>, cheered him up by finding “some English books from a library” along with “2 or 3
                     volumes of <span class="titlem">Gaglianiʼs Magazine</span>”—that is, one of the periodicals issued by <a class="link_ref" href="galignani_note.php"><span class="orgName">Librairie Galignani</span></a>, the Paris‐based English‐language publisher, bookseller, and circulating library.</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.1.3. </span><span class="head">The Ruskinsʼ Program of Age‐Appropriate Reading</span></h3>
                  <p>The <span class="orgName">Beinecke Library</span> owns two bound collections of small books that, if they belonged to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> at all, probably date from his earliest years of reading: one volume, <a class="link_ref" href="#WIDOW" title="2"><span class="titlem">“The Widow of Roseneath etc.”</span></a>, collects didactic, moral, and relgious works; and the other volume, <a class="link_ref" href="#FAIRYTALES" title="1"><span class="titlem">“Fairy Tales”</span></a> contains fantasy stories. While the responsibility for the arrangement and binding
                     of the two collections is unknown, the thematic division between the collections reflects
                     what <span class="persName">William McCarthy</span> characterizes as the “Manichaean . . . need to dichotomize” the “story about the
                     way childrenʼs literature developed” and “then to extol or damn its dichotomized terms”
                     (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MCCARTHYBARBAULDLESSONS"><span class="persName">McCarthy</span>, <span class="titlem">“Mother of All Discourses”</span></a>, 198). On one side, the collection <span class="titlem">“Fairy Tales”</span> binds together works that <span class="persName">Charles Lamb</span> would have approved as akin to “old classics of the nursery”. According to <span class="persName">Lamb</span>ʼs well‐known tirade, “wild tales” of imagination inspired in the reader a “beautiful
                     Interest” by making “the child a man, while all the time he suspected himself to be
                     no bigger than a child”. On the other side, the didactic works collected in <a class="link_ref" href="#WIDOW" title="2"><span class="titlem">“The Widow of Roseneath etc.”</span></a> would have seemed to <span class="persName">Lamb</span> the product of “<span class="persName">Mrs. B[arbauld]</span>ʼs &amp; <span class="persName">Mrs. Trimmer</span>ʼs nonsense”, in which “Science . . . [had] succeeded to Poetry”, resulting in “Knowledge”
                     made “insignificant &amp; vapid”, suitable only to puff up a child “with conceit of his
                     own powers”. “<span class="itaaic">Damn them</span>”, <span class="persName">Lamb</span> anathematized; “I mean the cursed Barbauld Crew, those <span style="font-style:italic">Blights &amp; Blasts</span> of all that is <span style="font-style:italic">Human</span> in man &amp; child” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#LAMBSLETTERS"><span class="titlem">Lamb to S. T. Coleridge, <span class="date">23 October 1802</span></span>, in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Letters of Charles and Mary Anne Lamb</span></span></a>, 2:81–82).</p>
                  <p>While the separately bound collections preserved at the Beinecke appear to reflect
                     this division, Ruskinʼs parents evidently took no part in this contest between the
                     Romantics and the educationists, if they were even aware of it. Recent scholarship
                     has shown how “Science” and “Poetry” or concepts of <span style="font-style:italic">reason</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">imagination</span> were more entangled in education and childrenʼs literature of the long <span class="date">eighteenth century</span> than <span class="persName">Lamb</span> cared to admit; and critics have revolutionized our understanding of how women educationists
                     such as <span class="persName">Letitia Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName">Sarah Trimmer</span> contributed an alternative sociability and sense of self to Romanticism. Moreover,
                     where <span class="persName">Lamb</span> saw a uniform pedagogy in the educationistsʼ “nonsense”, scholars have discerned
                     distinct politics in <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs Dissenter progressivism and in <span class="persName">Trimmer</span>ʼs Anglican conservatism. The Ruskins must have been able to distinguish these differences,
                     as well, yet the evidence points to catholicity in their choices of childrenʼs literature.
                     They shared neither the Romanticsʼ hostility toward progressive instructional works
                     such as the Edgeworthsʼ practical education nor <span class="persName">Trimmer</span>ʼs suspicions of imaginative works such as fairy tales, whether new or traditional.</p>
                  <p>While they were not doctrinaire in their tastes, the elder Ruskins did adhere to a
                     program of graduated and progressive age‐appropriate reading for children that had
                     been introduced at the end of the previous century by <span class="persName">Mrs. Barbauld</span> and developed by the Edgeworths, and they proceeded according to a plan. Precise
                     dates are elusive for when <span class="persName">John</span> first engaged with many of the works he is known or believed to have read in his
                     youth, but distinct phases of readings can be discerned. These phases can be correlated
                     to developments in his own writing, which reflect his reading both in content and
                     in the materiality of typography and illustration. The age‐appropriate layers of reading
                     are permeable, however, as over time <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> retained his affection for re‐reading some works for children even into adulthood.
                     The periods of age‐appropriate reading into which the following <a class="link_ref" href="#CHRONOLOGY" title="Chronology [under development]">Chronology</a> is divided are therefore approximate but not arbitrary, being based both on available
                     documentation about <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books and on his response to books in his writing.</p>

As <span class="persName">Janet Bottoms</span> defines this taste, Romantics like <span class="persName">Lamb</span> and <span class="persName">Coleridge</span> tended to look backward nostalgically to their own childhoods for examples of imaginative
                     engagement. For them, traditional tales escaped the confines of “the social limits
                     and moral laws of the familiar world”—the boundaries within which the educationists
                     aimed to socialize the child subject. The old “wild” tales, rather, “developed in
                     unpredictable ways, rewarding hero or heroine with honours and wealth”; and instead
                     of “foregrounding actual children” as subjects, encouraged identification with (in
                     <span class="persName">Coleridge</span>ʼs description) “excessive smallness combined with great power”, thus “exhibiting,
                     through the working of the imagination, the idea of power in the will”. Such tales
                     as the <span class="titlem">Arabian Nights</span>, <span class="persName">Coleridge</span> emphasizes, “cause no deep feeling of a moral kind—whether of religion or love; but
                     an impulse of motion is communicated to the mind without excitement, and this is the
                     reason of their being so generally read and admired” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BOTTOMSBATTLE"><span class="persName">Bottoms</span>, <span class="titlem">“The Battle of the (Childrenʼs) Books”</span></a>, 215; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#COLERIDGELECTURES1818"><span class="persName">Coleridge</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lectures on the Principles of Judgement, Culture, and European Literature</span></span> [<span class="date">1818</span>]</a>, lecture 11, 191; and see <a class="link_ref" href="#SINBAD" title="2">Untraced Books no. 2</a>).</p>
                  <p><span class="titlem">“The Children in the Wood” (or “Babes in the Wood”)</span>, while not seemingly a work that empowered the child reader, was likewise looked
                     back upon as a powerfully imaginative tale by <span class="persName">Lamb</span> and <span class="persName">Wordsworth</span>. In the <span class="date">1800</span> Preface to <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Lyrical Ballads</span></span>, <span class="persName">Wordsworth</span> cites lines from the original ballad, “These pretty babes with hand in hand / Went
                     wandering up and down” j as an example of plain language that “can excite thought
                     or feeling in the Reader”, suggestive of <span class="persName">Coleridge</span>ʼs “impulse of motion . . . communicated to the mind” (<span class="persName">Wordsworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Prose Works</span></span> . . .). As <span class="persName">Patricia Crain</span> remarks, however, the tale is also invoked by <span class="persName">Wordsworth</span> (and by <span class="persName">Lamb</span> in <span class="titlem">“Dream Children”</span>) as doing the work of providing “adult consciousness of childhood as a privileged
                     time and space thatʼs been lost, thatʼs died, and that yet remains infinitely accessible
                     to adult memory and imagination”. Through this approach to traditional tales, <span class="persName">Crain</span> argues, Romantics such as <span class="persName">Wordsworth</span>, <span class="persName">Coleridge</span>, and <span class="persName">Lamb</span> converted the “newly privileged (and newly imagined) childrenʼs innocence” that developed
                     in the <span class="date">eighteenth century</span> “into an envied source of power and knowledge” for the adult personae of the “Immortality
                     Ode” and essays in <span class="persName">Elia</span> (<span class="persName">Crain</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Forgotten Children</span></span>, 53, 49).</p>
                  <p>A construction of childhood innocence functions similarly in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span class="date">1868</span> essay, <span class="titlem">“Fairy Stories”</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 19:000–00), but there is no evidence that, ca. <span class="date">1823–25</span>, traditional tales like <span class="titlem">“The Children in the Wood”</span> were segregated in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs reading from the more modern fairy tales preserved in <a class="link_ref" href="#FAIRYTALES" title="1"><span class="titlem">“Fairy Tales”</span></a> or from the the “cautionary stories”, moral tales “founded on facts”, or the catechistic

Regarding traditional tales, we also do not know in what form <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> experienced them, if at all. In the <span class="date">early nineteenth century</span>, <span class="titlem">“The Children in the Wood”</span> was rewritten in forms ranging from a prose version that preserved the plot outline
                     and characters of the original ballad to reconceptions that rescued the babes from
                     death to become paragons of virtue and industry (see <span class="persName">Crain</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Forgotten Children</span></span>, 51; and <a class="link_ref" href="#CHILDRENINTHEWOOD" title="1">Untraced Books no. 1</a>).</p>

                  <p>This period, from ages seven to ten, extends from <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first extant juvenilia (<span class="titlem">MS I</span>) to his first letters that he composed and sent to his father independently of his

This period is distinctly Edgeworthian, the dialogues in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

                  <p>Finally, questions of the provenance of publications for children in the Ruskin library
                     are preliminary to the more complex question of what counted for the Ruskins as <span style="font-style:italic">childrenʼs literature</span>. In the first decade of <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs reading, the elder Ruskinsʼ acquisition of books by <span class="persName">Letitia Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span> reflect their familiarity with the concept of age‐appropriate texts, even though
                     <span class="persName">John</span> read above the age recommended for certain texts. At the same time, his parents chose,
                     or he appropriated, texts that were not conceived for a child audience but contained
                     features that appealed to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs imagination—for example, <span class="persName">Byron</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Manfred</span></span> and <span class="persName">Scott</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Monastery</span></span> and <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Abbot</span></span>.</p>
                  <p>Yet evidence shows that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> both read above his age category (and not always with comprehension) and ranged beyond
                     the kinds of texts typically thought appropriate for children (e.g., <span class="persName">Joyce</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scientific Dialogues</span></span>, which he copied verbatim in <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . .

                  <p>From <span class="date">1827 through 1845</span>, <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> kept a family budget in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">RF MS 28, known as the Account Book</span></a>, held by <span class="orgName">The Ruskin</span>. For each year, he exactingly and exhaustively recorded expenditures, divided by
                     categories of expenditure, and maintained these categories consistently from year
                     to year. The category entitled “Sundries” included books along with many other miscellaneous
                     household items. In <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span> sifted the book purchases from among the other items in “Sundries” and collected
                     the titles in summary notes, which he divided by year of purchase and distributed
                     throughout the edition, typically hanging the note from the mention of a book acquisition
                     in one of the letters. The following list expands on <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs brief identifications, by adding context drawn from book advertisements and book
                     reviews, thus situating <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs acquisitions in the burgeoning period of innovative book production of the <span class="date">1820s–40s</span> (The year <span class="date">1830</span> is itemized for the first time, <span class="persName">Burd</span> having omitted a list of book purchases for that year from <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, presumably because no letters are extant from that year, thus allowing no occasion
                     for annotation.)</p>
                  <p><span class="persName">Burd</span> was shrewd in matching <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs notations of expenditures with the prices of specific editions available at the
                     time, but he did not document the source of his information, and he omitted bibliographical
                     details. <span class="persName">James Dearden</span> folded <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs lists into the alphabetized entries in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, adding a layer of provenance information based on surviving catalogues of the family
                     library. <span class="persName">Dearden</span> also supplied bibliographical information drawn from surviving copies of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books. In the absence of a surviving copy, <span class="persName">Dearden</span> defaulted to <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs identification or to a first edition. The following lists collate and cross‐reference
                     <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs entries with <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs notes in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, and with <span class="persName">Dearden</span>ʼs entries in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, but with the additional aims of specifying <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs acquisitions more precisely and contextualizing the purchases in the contemporaneous
                     publishing and the book market.</p>
                  <p>For some books presumed to have belonged to the Ruskin family library prior to <span class="date">1827</span>, see <a class="link_ref" href="#DESCRIPTIONS" title="Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Boyhood and Youth">Physical Descriptions of Some Books Used by Ruskin in Boyhood and Youth</a>, along with Untraced Books, which primarily documents books mentioned in the family
                     letters as having been acquired for <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs use in his youth, but which are otherwise untraced. While not all the books itemized
                     in <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">Account Book</span> were intended specifically for <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs use, by <span class="date">1827</span> the distinction was fading between his age‐appropriate reading and shared family
                     reading. In areas such as classical literature, <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs purchases suggest that he was anticipating <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs tutoring in Latin and Greek. Acquisitions that seem above <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs reading level may have chosen by <span class="persName">John James</span> for his own and <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs use, but he may also acquired such items with the thought of his sonʼs future education.</p>
                  <p>Some cautions are advisabe in interpreting <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs listings under “Sundries”. Since his purpose in the <span class="titlem">Account Book</span> was to record expenses, he categorized the items in “Sundries” by month of the year,
                     not by the kinds of objects purchased. Accordingly, his abbreviated entries are frequently
                     ambiguous or obscure, and educated guesswork is required to sort out authorsʼ names
                     and titles of books from what may have been the name of a tradesman or a person employed
                     by <span class="persName">John James</span> or even a now unfamiliar name for a household item. Another caveat about <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs acquisitions is that we cannot know whether all the books he purchased were meant
                     for <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span>. As cautioned in <a class="link_ref" href="#PROVENANCE" title="Provenance">Provenance</a>, some acquisitions could have been intended as gifts for relatives. Even purchases
                     of childrenʼs literature could have been destined for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs cousins.</p>
                  <p>For transcription and contextualization of some other kinds of expenditures included

                                 in <span class="date">1824</span>, and which likewise included <span class="persName">Richardson</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Grandison</span></span>—the Novelistʼs Library (1821–24), edited with prefaces by Walter Scott, and sold
                                 by Hurst, Robinson and Co. Of the final volumes of this series, which were issued
                                 in 1824, three thick volumes (vols. 6–8) were devoted respectively to the three Richardson
                                 novels—Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison (Gossman, Spreading the Word, 48–49).
                                 Separated out as set, the three “Novels of Richardson” volumes were advertised in
                                 1824 at 4&amp; 4s in boards (“Ballantyneʼs Novelistʼs Library”). John James—probably thinking
                                 that the stories involving seduction in Pamela and Clarissa should not be allowed
                                 into the household—may have been able to obtain either the Barbauld or the Scott editions
                                 of Grandison at 20s (equal to 1&amp;) as an odd item from their respective series. Whatever
                                 its origin, the Ruskinsʼ acquisition of Sir Charles Grandison reflected a minor Richardson
                                 revival.</li>

                                 "author of Lectures on the Doctrine of the Holy Trinity" was published by the London
                                 publisher, Ebenezer Palmer of Paternoster Row and Great Surrey Street, at 8s. Part
                                 1 had been published by Palmer in 1826 at 5s 6d, and reviewed in the October 1826
                                 issue of the Evangelical Magazine. With part 2, the publisher added a frontispiece

The responsibility for
                                 and circumstances of binding these three items as “Fairy Tales” are unknown. This
                                 title on the spine applies most legitimately to the first of the items, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Mother Bunchʼs Fairy Tales</span></span>, whereas the other two items belong only marginally, each containing just one or
                                 two stories that feature a fairy or fantastical events. Regardless of the consistency
                                 of the collection, however, an implicit rationale becomes apparent by comparing the
                                 contents of another bound collection, <a class="link_ref" href="#WIDOWDISCUSSION" title="Discussion.

Lumsden and Son of Glasgow</span>. Now highly regarded among collectors, <span class="orgName">Lumsden</span>ʼs childrenʼs books are distinguished by “a certain trimness (primness one might almost
                                 call it) in the covers, the quality of the paper used, the excellent type‐face, the
                                 occasional use of coloured inks for text and illustrations, usually bistre or sanguine,
                                 occasionally green, and a few hand‐coloured illustrations”. In their own time, however,
                                 the books were apparently little known outside of <span class="placeName">Scotland</span>; and even in their own country, they were not widely popular, because their prices
                                 were considered rather dear, even at two pence or six pence per copy—cheaper and less
                                 elegant chapbooks by this publisher being more commonly found (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ROSCOEANDBRIMMELLJAMESLUMSDEN"><span class="persName">Roscoe</span> and <span class="persName">Brimmell</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">James Lumsden and Son of Glasgow</span></span></a>, xi, xiii) <br/><br/> The <span class="orgName">Lumsden</span> firm produced childrenʼs books ca. <span class="date">1790–1850</span>, but seldom printed dates on title pages (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ROSCOEANDBRIMMELLJAMESLUMSDEN"><span class="persName">Roscoe</span> and <span class="persName">Brimmell</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">James Lumsden and Son of Glasgow</span></span></a>, xv). The three books bound together here are all undated. <span class="persName">Dearden</span>, without explanation, dates them tentatively as <span class="date">1814</span>, presumably because that date is the lower limit suggested by <span class="persName">Roscoe</span> and <span class="persName">Brimmell</span> in each of their analytical descriptions of of these books, as follows.<br/></li>

Most of the stories in this anthology originated in fairy tales by <span class="persName">Marie‐Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville, Comtesse dʼAulnoy</span> (ca. <span class="date">1650–1705</span>), written for the sophisticated <span class="placeName">Paris</span> literary salons in the <span class="date">age of Louis XIV</span>. The texts translated into English from <span class="persName">Countess dʼAulnoy</span>ʼs originals have a complex history. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs copy matches the bibliographical description of an edition published ca. <span class="date">1817</span> by the firm <span class="orgName">J. Lumsden and Son</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ROSCOEANDBRIMMELLJAMESLUMSDEN"><span class="persName">Roscoe</span> and <span class="persName">Brimmell</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">James Lumsden and Son of Glasgow</span></span></a>, 68–69 [no. 102]; see <a class="link_ref" href="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION" title="Documentation and discussion.

The <span class="orgName">Lumsden</span> edition was a piracy and abridgement of an English edition published in <span class="date">1802</span> and <span class="date">1817</span> by the <span class="placeName">London</span> publisher of childrenʼs books, <span class="orgName">John Harris</span>; and the <span class="orgName">Harris</span> editions were in turn based on editions (ca. <span class="date">1773–99</span>) published by the firm of <span class="orgName">John Newbery</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BLAMIRESMOTHERBUNCH"><span class="persName">Blamires</span>, <span class="titlem">“From Madame dʼAulnoy to Mother Bunch”</span></a>, 75; and see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MOONHARRIS"><span class="persName">Moon</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">John Harrisʼs Books for Youth</span></span></a>, 72 [nos. 470–71).<br/><br/> <span class="orgName">Newbery</span> originated the title, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Mother Bunchʼs Fairy Tales</span></span>, and adapted an earlier English translation (<span class="date">1721</span>, reprinted frequently through <span class="date">1817</span>, and including tales by other French salon writers). This early eighteenth‐century
                                       English translation, according to <span class="persName">David Blamires</span>, was faithful to the original, sophisticated French tales and intended for adult
                                       readers. The <span class="orgName">Newbery</span> edition and its descendents simplified the texts for child readers, and reassigned
                                       the authorship from <span class="persName">Madame dʼAulnoy</span> to the fictitious Mother Bunch, an English folklore figure whom children could imagine
                                       as a storyteller similar to Mother Goose. Through these successive adaptations of
                                       the English texts by <span class="orgName">Newbery</span>, <span class="orgName">Harris</span>, and <span class="orgName">Lumsden</span> for an audience of middle‐class children—as well as through issues of individual
                                       tales in chapbook form for a working‐class audience—the French salon fairy tales came
                                       be regarded as English and traditional (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BLAMIRESMOTHERBUNCH"><span class="persName">Blamires</span>, <span class="titlem">“From Madame dʼAulnoy to Mother Bunch”</span></a>, 75–78).<br/><br/> In the subtitle, first applied by <span class="orgName">Newbery</span> and carried through the adaptations by <span class="orgName">Harris</span> and <span class="orgName">Lumsden</span>, the specification that the tales were meant to amuse “little masters and misses”
                                       signals that the tales were meant for younger children. For <span class="orgName">Newbery</span> in the eighteenth century, the purpose of such books was to teach children basic
                                       reading, as compared with books designated for “young gentlemen and ladies”, which
                                       contained “lessons of life” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#TOWNSENDNEWBERYTELESCOPE"><span class="persName">Townsend</span>, <span class="titlem">“John Newbery and Tom Telescope”</span></a>, 82–83).<br/></li>

                                       presumably was a marketing ploy. The text, which in some copies includes a description
                                       of the Seven Wonders of the World, was apparently based on a collection first published
                                       in <span class="placeName">London</span>, ca. <span class="date">1780</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SOBERSIDESCHRISTMASTALESHOCKLIFFE"><span class="titlem">“Stories before 1850. 0220: Anon.

                                       and morality in childhood education, but the stories in themselves do little to redress
                                       this supposed failing. The collection is miscellaneous, some tales teaching prudent
                                       and moral conduct, some adopting an oriental flavor, and only a few entailing magic
                                       or fairies. Two of the latter sort feature dervises (i.e., dervishes), who reward
                                       hospitality with magical riches, but retract the reward and punish characters who
                                       overstep boundaries owing to greed or excess curiosity.<br/><br/> The frontispiece contains an emblem of a child choosing between folly and wisdom,
                                       which may have contributed to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own use of visual emblems, such as <a class="link_ref" href="heights_of_wisdom_drawing_msi.php">“Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools” [Miscellaneous Drawing, <span class="titlem">MS I</span>]</a>.</li>

                                 items together is unknown. Although not stated explicitly, <span class="persName">Helen Viljoen</span>ʼs description in the exhibition catalogue, <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskinʼs Backgrounds, Friendships, and Interests</span></span></a> suggests that the binding was present when received from the collector, <span class="persName">F. J. Sharp</span> (pp. 6–7 [item 5.<span style="font-style:italic">a</span>]). <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> appears to believe that the binding was present even when “given to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> by his <span class="persName">Father</span>“, but it is unlikely that such disparate items would have been bound together originally.<br/><br/> A rationale, if not the specific occasion for the collection can be inferred, however,
                                 if the binding of these eight items was made in concert with the binding of <a class="link_ref" href="#FAIRYTALESDISCUSSION" title="Documentation and discussion. For the three items in the binding see Dearden Library of John Ruskin 13 [no. 74] 19 [no. 115] 32...">Fairy Tales</a>. As compared with the latter, the items collected here share an emphasis on “cautionary”
                                 tales (to draw on the subtitle of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Cowslip</span></span>). Since the early nineteenth century, such Romantic writers as <span class="persName">Charles Lamb</span>, <span class="persName">S. T. Coleridge</span>, and <span class="persName">William Wordsworth</span> had polemically argued in favor of appealing to childrenʼs imagination with fairy
                                 tales as opposed to training their reason and morals with “instructive” and “cautionary”
                                 tales and dialogues by the “cursed <span class="persName">Barbauld</span> Crew”, as <span class="persName">Lamb</span> anathematized this group largely of women writers. In our time, critics have exposed
                                 the politics underpinning these divisions, but in the late nineteenth or early twentieth
                                 century, which was probably when these two collections of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books were bound, the reputation of <span class="persName">Anna Letitia Barbauld</span> had been disassociated from her politics and reduced to bland high‐mindedness—a “valuation”
                                 of this writing that suggests, as <span class="persName">William McCarthy</span> complains, “that it entirely lacked humor, irony, or wit” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#MCCARTHYBARBAULDRECEPTION"><span class="persName">McCarthy</span>, <span class="titlem">“‘A High‐Minded Christian Lady’”</span></a>, 179; and see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CLARKEBARBAULDCREW"><span class="persName">Clarke</span>, <span class="titlem">“‘The Cursed Barbauld Crew’”</span></a>, 91–93). Such a valuation was perhaps implicitly placed on these eight items by binding
                                 them together.<br/><br/> The reductive valuation may not have been <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs, but it seems unlikely that he could have been responsible for binding this collection
                                 since, as noted in the following descriptions, he annotated some of the items separately,
                                 bequeathing them to <span class="persName">Joan Severn</span> and her children. One of the annotations is dated “<span class="date">1889</span>”, and another “<span class="date">1889–1890</span>”, clues that the binding was ordered after <span class="date">1890</span> by someone other than <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>—perhaps by <span class="persName">Joan Severn</span>—since by that time, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> himself would not have been in a mental state to take such an initiative.</li>

                                 of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs father” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskinʼs Backgrounds, Friendships, and Interests</span></span></a>, 7). From the <span class="date">seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries</span>, English collections of <span class="persName">Aesop</span>ʼs fables did appeal across age groups and were accessible across class boundaries.
                                 The original adult readers of the <span class="date">1722</span> translation by <span class="persName">Samuel Croxall</span> (<span class="date">1688/89–1752</span>) would have understood his lengthy “instructive applications” appended to each fable
                                 as whiggish ripostes to the Jacobite <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fables of Aesop and Other Eminent Mythologists</span></span> (<span class="date">1691</span>, <span class="date">1699</span>) by <span class="persName">Sir Roger LʼEstrange</span> (<span class="date">1616–1704</span>). Notwithstanding their political applications, both translators presented their
                                 fables as appropriate reading also for children, just as <span class="persName">John Locke</span> (<span class="date">1632–1704</span>) considered “<span class="persName">Aesop</span>ʼs Fables . . . the best . . . Stories apt to delight and entertain a Child”, while
                                 the stories “may yet afford useful Reflections to a grown Man; and if his Memory retain
                                 them all his Life after, he will not repent to find them there, among his manly Thoughts”.
                                 In <span class="date">1703</span>, <span class="persName">Locke</span> produced his own interlinear Latin and English version of <span class="persName">Aesop</span> as a scheme for teaching children language (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#LEWISENGLISHFABLE"><span class="persName">Lewis</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The English Fable</span></span></a>, 20, 25–26, 40; <span class="persName">Locke</span>, to come). Thus, while we do not know exactly when (in <span class="date">1811</span> or afterward) <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> acquired <span class="persName">Croxall</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Aesop</span></span> or for what purpose, he may have conceived of the book both as edification for himself
                                 and as basic instruction in reading and grammar, as well as morality, for a child.<br/><br/> In the <span class="date">eighteenth century</span>, according to Stephen H. Daniel, the taste for fable collections with political agendas
                                 like <span class="persName">LʼEstrange</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Croxall</span>ʼs declined in favor of versions deemed appropriate to child readers, “in which delicacy
                                 and daintiness become characteristic traits” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DANIELFABLES"><span class="titlem">“Political and Philosophical Uses of Fables in Eighteenth‐Century England”</span></a>, 170). Nonetheless, <span class="persName">Croxall</span>ʼs collection maintained its grip long into the next century, perhaps because its
                                 anti‐Jacobite posture was deemed a safe choice for the early Victorian household (although
                                 another youth in <span class="placeName">Camberwell</span>, <span class="persName">Robert Browning</span>, was “affected . . . so painfully” by the violent death of a lion in <span class="titlem">“Croxallʼs Fables”</span> “that he could no longer endure the sight of the book” and “buried it between the
                                 stuffing and the woodwork of an old dining‐room chair, where it stood for lost” [<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ORRBROWNING"><span class="persName">Orr</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Life and Letters of Robert Browning</span></span></a>, 28]).<br/><br/> <span class="persName">Croxall</span> styled himself as a protector of British youth, dedicating his collection to the
                                 five‐year‐old <span class="persName">George Montagu‐Dunk</span>, future earl of <span class="placeName">Halifax</span> (<span class="date">1716–71</span>). There was urgency to guard a noble youth who, “though but in” his “fifth Year”,
                                 was “capable of reading any Thing in the <span style="font-style:italic">English</span> Tongue, without the least Hesitation”, and might be exposed to versions of <span class="titlem">Aesop</span> like <span class="persName">LʼEstrangeʼ</span>s, which likewise claimed to be intended for “the Use and Instruction of Children;
                                 who, being . . . mere blank Paper, <span style="font-style:italic">are ready indifferently for . . . the first Comer to write Saint or Devil upon them,
                                    which he pleases</span>”. “[W]hat poor Devils”, <span class="persName">Croxall</span> exclaimed, would <span class="persName">LʼEstrange</span>ʼs book “make of those Children, who should be so unfortunate as to . . . imbibe his
                                 pernicious Principles! Principles coined and suited to promote the Growth, and serve
                                 the Ends, of Popery and arbitary Power”. Such lessons are not meant for the “Children
                                 of <span style="font-style:italic">Britain</span> who “are born with free Blood in their Veins, and suck in Liberty with their very
                                 Milk”. <span class="persName">Croxall</span> accuses <span class="persName">LʼEstrange</span> of perverting <span class="persName">Aesop</span>ʼs message, “particularly when any political Instruction is couched in the Application”;
                                 and he commends himself as “a Lover of Liberty and Truth; an Enemy to Tyranny, either
                                 in Church or State; and one who detests Party Animosities, and factious Divisions,

                                 that his youthful markings were to be retained, and to number the volumes 1, 2, and
                                 3, since he had “lost the rest” of the volumes (quoted in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 8 [no. 34]). The remaining volumes sent for binding would have been the original
                                 volumes 1, 2, and 5, with volumes 3, 4, and 6 gone missing, according to details in
                                 an <span class="date">1868</span> partial catalogue of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs books, as cited by <span class="persName">Dearden</span>. On this evidence, <span class="persName">Dearden</span> suggests that, since the <span class="persName">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName">Viljoen</span> copy at the <span class="placeName">Beinecke Library</span> “is not bound in the style specified in the letter to <span class="orgName">Simpson &amp; Co.</span>”, this volume “may be one of the volumes which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> mentioned he had lost” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 8 [no. 34], and see cviii–cxii). This possibility is ruled out, however, since the
                                 <span class="persName">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName">Viljoen</span> copy, which is a six‐volumes‐in‐one edition, complete in itself, cannot have formed
                                 a part of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs original set.<br/><br/> <span class="persName">Dearden</span> gives <span class="date">1792</span> as the year of publication for the <span class="persName">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName">Viljoen</span> copy, but this date is not supported by the title page, which is undated. Its publication
                                 by <span class="orgName">J. F. Dove</span> places it, rather, as a reprint in a series conceived by <span class="persName">John Fowler Dove</span> (<span class="date">1787–1866</span>), <span class="placeName">St. Johnʼs Square</span>, <span class="placeName">Clerkenwell</span>, <span class="placeName">London</span>. Starting in the first half of the <span class="date">1820s</span>, <span class="persName">Dove</span>ʼs printing house issued the <span class="titlem">“Doveʼs English Classics”</span> series, which played a part in the early history of books illustrated by steel engraving—a
                                 development that contributed to the success of the literary annuals and gift books
                                 during the same period (see <a class="link_ref" href="annuals_note.php#COLLECTEDEDITIONS">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books: Collected Editions</a>). At first, <span class="orgName">Dove</span> produced these reprints as “Printed for the Proprietors of the English Classics by
                                 J. F. Dove”—the <span class="orgName">“proprietors”</span> being comprised of a long list of publishers, including <a class="link_ref" href="smith_elder_note.php"><span class="orgName">Smith, Elder &amp; Co.</span></a> from the time when that firm was located on <span class="placeName">Fenchurch Street</span>. Two books in the <span class="titlem">“English Classics”</span> series, which may well have been acquired through <span class="orgName">Smith, Elder</span>, held an important place in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs boyhood library, his <span class="date">1824</span> copy of <span class="persName">Pope</span>ʼs translation of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Iliad</span></span>, and his <span class="date">1825</span> copy of <span class="persName">Dryden</span>ʼs translation of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Aeneid</span></span> and other works. The <span class="titlem">“English Classics”</span> reprint of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> would have appeared too late, however, to have served as his boyhood copy, since
                                 <span class="persName">Aikin</span> and <span class="persName">Barbauld</span>ʼs tales and dialogues perceptively influenced some of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs earliest extant juvenilia from <span class="date">1826</span> (see, e.g., <a class="link_ref" href="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Needless Alarm”</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>).<br/><br/> As <span class="persName">Naomi Lightman</span> comments, “as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs copy [held by the <span class="orgName"></span>] has no date, we cannot know when it was purchased” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#LIGHTMANDEBTTOBARCAULD"><span class="titlem">“‘No Man Could Owe More’”</span></a>, 264). According to <span class="titlem">WorldCat</span>, a date of purchase was not possible prior to <span class="date">1827</span>, when <span class="orgName">Dove</span> published <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> with a frontispiece and title page engraved by <span class="persName">Charles Heath</span> (<span class="date">1785–1848</span>) after a drawing by <span class="persName">Henry Corbould</span> (<span class="date">1787–1844</span>), and with the series title <span class="titlem">“English Classics”</span> printed on the “cover”. Supporting evidence for an <span class="date">1827</span> publication date is supplied by an <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ENGLISHCLASSICSADVERTISEMENT">advertisement for the <span class="titlem">“English Classics”</span> series</a>—an advertisement that is itself undated, but that is included with the Google Books
                                 reproduction of an <span class="date">1825</span> <span class="persName">Dove</span> reprint of <span class="persName">Walton</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Complete Angler</span></span>. No listing of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> appears among either the titles “Now Ready” or the titles “In the Press”. The “Ready”
                                 list does include, however, the <span class="date">1824</span> <span class="persName">Pope</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Iliad</span></span> and the <span class="date">1825</span> <span class="persName">Dryden</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works of Virgil</span></span>, suggesting that an <span class="date">1827</span> <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> lay too far in the future to project the status even of “In the Press”.<br/><br/> A bibliographical detail of the undated <span class="persName">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName">Viljoen</span> copy likewise points to publication in the <span class="date">second half of the 1820s</span>. While the <span class="titlem">WorldCat</span> description is silent whether the <span class="date">1827</span> <span class="titlem">“English Classics”</span> version of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> was, like earlier volumes in the series, printed for the <span class="orgName">“proprietor”</span> publishers, the <span class="persName">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName">Viljoen</span> copy identifies itself as “Printed and Published by <span class="persName">J. F. Dove</span>, <span class="placeName">St. Johnʼs Square</span>”. According to <span class="persName">Laurence Worms</span>, this imprint took the place of the “Printed for the <span class="orgName">Proprietors of English Classics</span>” “within a couple of years” of the <span class="date">mid‐1820s</span> series but no later than <span class="date">1833</span> when <span class="persName">Dove</span> retired (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WORMSDOVESENGLISHCLASSICS"><span class="persName">Worms</span>, <span class="titlem">“Doveʼs English Classics”</span></a>, accessed <span class="date">27 March 2022</span>). Apparently, the “Published and Printed” imprint—accompanied by a device of a dove
                                 bearing an olive branch, and the motto “perseverantia et amicis [perseverance and
                                 friendship]”—represented an advance beyond acting only as a printer for large shareholding
                                 publisher groups.<br/><br/>  The textual history of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> does bear consequences for what edition <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> first used. In an analysis of the publishing history of the book, <span class="persName">Aileen Fyfe</span> explains that, <span class="date">from 1792 until 1823</span>, the text of the first edition was controlled by the first publisher, <span class="persName">Joseph Johnson</span>, his successor <span class="orgName">Rowland Hunter</span>, and other publishers to whom <span class="orgName">Hunter</span> sold shares. In <span class="date">1823</span>, to maintain copyright, the shareholders solicited a corrected and slightly expanded
                                 edition from <span class="persName">John Aikin</span>ʼs son, <span class="persName">Arthur Aikin</span>, which was published as the thirteenth edition, apparently in six volumes; and in
                                 <span class="date">1826</span>, an edition rearranged by <span class="persName">John Aikin</span>ʼs daughter, <span class="persName">Lucy Aikin</span>, was published in four volumes. Despite these new editions descending from the original,
                                 “from the <span class="date">mid‐1820s</span>”, <span class="persName">Fyfe</span> notes, “any publisher could print the original text of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span>, and a number did so”, including provincial and Scottish publishers (<span class="persName">Fyfe</span>, <span class="titlem">“Copyrights and Competition”</span>, 40). If <span class="persName">Dove</span> waited until <span class="date">1827</span> to reprint <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings</span></span>, even in its original text, he already lagged behind some other publishers.<br/><br/> The Ruskins would have entered the market for <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs initial copy of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> during the transitional period in the bookʼs publishing history, between the <span class="date">early‐ and mid‐1820s</span>, when the Aikins were revising the text in order to extend copyright, and when other
                                 publishers were issuing reprints of the first edition. At this point, the Ruskins
                                 would likely have acquired either the new edition of <span class="date">1823</span>, whose shareholder publishers included (since <span class="date">1815</span>) <span class="orgName">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</span>, who also published the Ruskinsʼ editions of <span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Early Lessons”</span> series; or they would have purchased a first‐edition reprint available from non‐shareholder
                                 publishers. At that time, those non‐shareholder reprints would not have included <span class="persName">Dove</span>ʼs, since, as we have seen, evidence shows him coming late to the game. Consequently,
                                 putting aside the <span class="persName">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName">Viljoen</span> <span class="persName">Dove</span> edition—undated, but probably after <span class="date">1827</span>—we cannot determine what state of the text of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Evenings at Home</span></span> was availble to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in his boyhood six‐volume version, whether the revised edition by <span class="persName">Arthur Aikin</span> or the original descended from the <span class="persName">Johnson</span>/<span class="orgName">Hunter</span> shareholders (or even as originally published by <span class="persName">Johnson</span>/<span class="orgName">Hunter</span>). A good bet may be the revised text of <span class="date">1823</span>, since the shareholders carrying that text, including <span class="orgName">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</span>, produced substantial print runs that sold well (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FYFECOPYRIGHTS"><span class="persName">Fyfe</span>, <span class="titlem">“Copyrights and Competition”</span></a>, 43); and the Ruskins were familiar with <span class="orgName">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</span> from their purchase of <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank</span></span> and <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded</span></span>. Definitive evidence, however, must await recovery of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs three stray volumes, as rebound by <span class="orgName">Simpson</span>.<br/><br/> As for the <span class="persName">Sharp</span>/<span class="persName">Viljoen</span> copy, given that it contains annotations by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> from later years, a plausible explanation may be that he acquired this <span class="persName">Dove</span> edition at some point to replace the missing volumes of his boyhood set, at or before
                                 the time of sending the surviving copies for rebinding; or, if the <span class="persName">Dove</span> reprint was a more youthful acquisition, it should be treated as an additional household
                                 copy, circa <span class="date">1830</span>. While the front endpaper contains illegible scrawls, one of which <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> was tempted to make out to be the letter <span style="font-style:italic">J</span> and interpret as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs earliest signature, all the legible marginalia is in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs mature hand. The back endpaper has the note: “p 315. Earth &amp; Stones — 331”, referring
                                 to pages comprising the twenty‐first evening, which is connected with mineralogy.

That the Ruskins acquired this novel by the French writer, <span class="persName">Sophie Ristaud Cottin</span> (<span class="date">1770–1807</span>), is consistent with their care to provide <span class="persName">John</span> with other works in this list “founded on facts”. At the same time, their acquisition
                                       of this particular historical novel invites the possibility that the Ruskins witnessed
                                       its popular musical stage adaptation, the “melodramatic opera” <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Exile</span></span>, dramatized by <span class="persName">Frederick Reynolds</span> (<span class="date">1764–1841</span>) and scored by <span class="persName">Joseph Mazzinghi</span> (<span class="date">1765–1844</span>).<br/><br/> The facts of the tale derive from the heroism of a Russian girl, <span class="persName">Praskovʼia Lupolova</span>, whose father had been unjustly exiled to <span class="placeName">Siberia</span>. In <span class="date">1803</span>, to correct the injustice and reverse her familyʼs exile, the twenty‐year‐old girl
                                       journeyed on foot from <span class="placeName">Ishim</span> in the <span class="placeName">Tyumen Oblast</span> of western <span class="placeName">Siberia</span> to <span class="placeName">St. Petersburg</span>, where she was able gain the sympathy of nobles who interceded to petition a pardon
                                       from <span class="persName">Czar Alexander I</span>. In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Élizabeth; ou, Les Exilés de Sibérie</span></span> (<span class="date">1806</span>), <span class="persName">Madame Cottin</span> renamed the brave and virtuous heroine <span class="persName">Élizabeth</span>, invented a variety of characters—from pious to sinister—to assist her on her journey,
                                       and at the end of her ordeal brought her into the midst of <span class="persName">Alexander</span>ʼs coronation in <span class="placeName">Moscow Cathedral</span>, where the girl dramatically interrupts the ceremony in order to plead her case.
                                       In this telling, it is a young Siberian noble who intervenes and helps convince the
                                       <span class="persName">czar</span>, thus winning <span class="persName">Élizabeth</span>ʼs hand in marriage along with her fatherʼs pardon. The novel was translated into
                                       English in <span class="date">1808</span>, influencing a generation with its clichéd depiction of <span class="placeName">Russia</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HELLERCOTTIN"><span class="persName">Heller</span>, <span class="titlem">“‘A Tale Founded upon the Facts’”</span></a>, 159–60; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#PHILLIPSNIHILISTKURORT"><span class="persName">Phillips</span>, <span class="titlem">“‘A Nihilist Kurort’”</span></a>, 474–78).<br/><br/> Because <span class="persName">Cottin</span> reformulated the story using the essential elements of melodrama—as summarized by
                                       <span class="persName">Wendy Heller</span>, “a virtuous hero and heroine, an evil antagonist (with collaborators), opportunities
                                       for action sequences and spectacle, an intricate and even improbable plot, a moral
                                       message, a sincere tone and a happy ending that averts tragedy”—the tale was quickly
                                       adapted for the stage. From two French melodramas to <span class="persName">Reynolds</span> and <span class="persName">Mazzinghi</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Exile</span></span> (<span class="date">1808</span>), <span class="persName">Heller</span> shows, the rendering evolved from a French classicist treatment to a complex spectacle
                                       with many scene changes (reproduced in a colored “childrenʼs copper plate picture”).
                                       In revivals of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Exile</span></span> in the <span class="date">1820s</span>, the aspect of spectacle was further elaborated by stage designers, who included
                                       <span class="persName">David Roberts</span>, with an emphasis on authenticity of representation. The <span class="persName">czar</span>ʼs coronation was replaced by the crowning of <span class="persName">Empress Elizabeth Petrovna</span>, an event that was simultaneously widely circulated in pictorial print culture. The
                                       emphasis on authenticity was regarded as educational as well as spectacular, and associations
                                       with the <span class="date">1821</span> British coronation of <span class="persName">George IV</span> added patriotism to the appeal (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HELLERCOTTIN"><span class="persName">Heller</span>, <span class="titlem">“‘A Tale Founded upon the Facts’”</span></a>, 161–73). Throughout the 1820s, <span class="persName">Reynolds</span> (whose eldest son, <span class="persName">Frederick Mansel Reynolds</span> [<span class="date">1800/01–50</span>] became editor of the literary annual best known for lavishness, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Keepsake</span></span>) became known for producing spectacles in this opening decade of French grand opera,
                                       inaugurated by <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">La muette de Portici</span></span> (<span class="date">1828</span>) composed by <span class="persName">Daniel Auber</span> (<span class="date">1782–1871</span>) to a libretto by <span class="persName">Eugène Scribe</span> (<span class="date">1791–1861</span>).

In the description of volume one of this set for the <span class="date">1965</span> exhibition catalog of the Sharp Collection, <span class="persName">Helen Gill Viljoen</span> wrote: “This volume is inscribed ‘<span class="persName">John Ruskin</span>’ in the handwriting of <span class="persName">Ruskinʼs Father</span> and presumably contains, on a blank page which follows, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs earliest known signature—a pencilled ‘<span class="persName">John Ruskin</span>’ apparently copied, in a most childish scrawl, from the name as written in ink by
                                       his Father” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskinʼs Backgrounds, Friendships, and Interests, as Reflected in the F. J. Sharp

While a more likely candidate for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs earliest surviving signature is his pencil print‐lettered “<span class="persName">John Ruskin</span>” signing his so‐called <a class="link_ref" href="jr_and_mr_to_jjr_1823-03-15.php"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">first letter</span></span></a>, which he dictated to his mother for his father on <span class="date">15 March 1823</span>, the book signature in <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs hand is valuable as a clue to the approximate date when he acquired this text.
                                       While <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> first took up a pen to write in ink around <span class="date">April 1827</span>, prior to this development he had already transitioned from a print to cursive hand,
                                       using a pencil, at least for rough draft. A reasonable guess, then, for his acquisition
                                       and first reading of <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span> is on or around his eighth birthday in <span class="date">February 1827</span>, an age in keeping with that of the eponymous hero. As <span class="persName">Edgeworth</span> specifies in the preface: “The following volumes contain the History of <span class="persName">Frank</span> from seven years old, where we left him [in Frank, part 4], till between ten and
                                       eleven” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="persName">Edgeworth</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, x; and see Frank, Part IV: Being the Ninth Part of Early Lessons, in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHWORKS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Novels and Selected Works of Maria Edgeworth</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Butler</span></a>, 12:223–37). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also used the identically formed signature on what his mother called his “first written
                                       letter” of <span class="date">May 1827</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">John to John James Ruskin, <span class="date">May 1827</span></span></a>; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Burd</span></a>, 157–58; and see <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php#CURSIVE">The Ruskin Family Handwriting: Ruskinʼs Cursive Hand</a>). <br/><br/> The first volume also contains a childʼs pencil drawings, which <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> quotes <span class="persName">Sharp</span> as describing: “‘On the inside cover and facing the title page in Vol. I [there]
                                       are two sketches, an elevation . . .’ and a pencilled floor plan of what Mr. <span class="persName">Sharp</span> conjectured to be the Ruskinsʼ <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> home, with what was probably a precocious attempt to indicate a winding staircase”.
                                       While <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> respectfully conveyed <span class="persName">Sharp</span>ʼs conjecture, she must have realized that <span class="placeName">Herne Hill</span> cannot be the subject of the sketch, which depicts a manor with two wings on either
                                       side of a center space and a semicircular front. As <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> notes, in volume 1 of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span>,“<span class="persName">Frank</span> is being taught how to draw a house ‘by a scale’”, indicating the more probable inspiration
                                       for the sketches (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#VILJOENRUSKINSBACKGROUNDS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskinʼs Backgrounds, Friendships, and Interests, as Reflected in the F. J. Sharp

[his own] house without much
                                       difficulty”, but his resulting drawing shows, as his cousin, <span class="persName">Mary</span>, remarks, “some of the rooms . . . larger than they were in reality, and some smaller”,
                                       plus he “‘forgot the stairs’” altogether—an omission that is pointedly corrected in
                                       <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs floor plan on the volumeʼs endpaper, regardless of what structure he intended the
                                       drawing to schematize. In the tale, the <span class="persName">Engineer</span> instructs <span class="persName">Frank</span> to make proper measurements of the rooms and draw the floor plan to scale, so that,
                                       by the end of the episode, <span class="persName">Frank</span>ʼs “plan of his house was now tolerably neatly finished; and this time the staircase
                                       was not forgotten; the breakfast room was not robbed to make space for the passage,
                                       and the library was of its just length, and, as <span class="persName">Mary</span> observed, none of the rooms were too large or too small—all were like reality. ‘And
                                       now’, said <span class="persName">Frank</span>, [‘]that I know how to draw by a scale, <span class="persName">Mary</span>s, you shall never see such wretched plans as this’, added he, crumpling up his first
                                       plan as he spoke, and throwing it away” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EDGEWORTHFRANKSEQUEL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Frank: A Sequel</span></span></a>, 308, 309, 313).

The caption refers to a <span class="orgName">British Post Office</span> packet, the <span class="name">Lady Hobart</span>, which was wrecked in <span class="date">June 1803</span> after scoring a heroic success early in the war with <span class="placeName">France</span>. While sailing from <span class="placeName">Halifax</span> to <span class="placeName">Falmouth</span>, the <span class="name">Lady Hobart</span> was pursued by a French schooner. Firing on the schooner, the British boarded the
                                 ship and captured its crew, which were soon thereafter transferred as prisoners of
                                 war to two English schooners nearby. British naval officers took possession of the
                                 French ship, and the <span class="name">Lady Hobart</span> continued on its way, carrying the French captain and his nephew. On <span class="date">June 28</span>, on a foggy night, the ship collided with a huge iceberg and rapidly sank. Twenty‐nine
                                 surviors filled two small boats carried by the packet, including the captain, <span class="persName">William Dorset Fellowes</span> (<span class="date">1769–1852</span>), the French captain, three women (one of them <span class="persName">Fellowes</span>ʼs spouse), and seamen. The boats carried few provisions, and for seven days the castaways
                                 suffered from exposure, hunger, and thirst, causing the French commander in a delirium
                                 to throw himself into the sea and drown. Nearing the Canadian coast, the boats were
                                 rescued on <span class="date">4 July</span>. <span class="persName">Fellowes</span> published an account of the ordeal, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">A Narrative of the Loss of His Majestyʼs Packet, the Lady Hobart</span></span>. Various editions of the narrative included a foldout frontispiece depicting the
                                 disaster, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> may have copied for his drawing. A scene of the disaster was also depicted the <span class="placeName">Bristol</span> marine painter, <span class="persName">Nicholas Pocock</span> (<span class="date">1740–1821</span>), and engraved by <span class="persName">Robert Pollard</span> (<span class="date">1755/56–1839</span>) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FELLOWESNARRATIVE"><span class="persName">Fellowes</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Narrative of the Loss of . . . the Lady Hobart</span></span></a>; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#POSTALMUSEUMBLOG-2019-06-27"><span class="persName">Stray</span>, <span class="titlem">“The Sinking of the Lady Hobart”</span></a>).<br/><br/> <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs caption for his drawing incorporates a title, <span class="titlem">“The Shipwreck”</span>, which may echo the title of the epic poem, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Shipwreck</span></span> (<span class="date">1762</span>, <span class="date">1764</span>, <span class="date">1769</span>), by the Scottish seaman and poet, <span class="persName">William Falconer</span> (<span class="date">1732–70</span>), which the Ruskins owned in at least two editions of <span class="date">1796</span> and <span class="date">1858</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 112 [nos. 868–69]). <span class="persName">Pocock</span> also illustrated an edition (<span class="date">1804</span>, <span class="date">1811</span>) of this poem (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#NPOCOCKDNB"><span class="persName">Cordingly</span>, <span class="titlem">“Pocock, Nicholas (1740–1821), marine painter”</span></a>), although the <span class="date">1796</span> edition owned by the Ruskins was illustrated by <span class="persName">Thomas Stothard</span> and limited to figures, without scenes of shipwreck (wreckage caused, in this case,
                                 not by an iceberg but by a storm driving the ship onto a rocky shore).<br/><br/> (65v–66r) The blank verso 65v is divided horizontally, with a pencil drawing of a

                                 are traces of vocabulary instruction.<br/><br/> (67r) In pencil, in <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs hand, “fa mi <span style="text-decoration: line-through">di</span> so la do” / “Duryhill” (unclear) / “do re mi fa sol la do”.<br/><br/> (67v) In pencil, <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs(?) hand, but very faint and the page badly smudged with some writing completely
                                 illegible, words including “annihilation”, “arrived”, “preserve”.<br/><br/> <span style="font-style:italic">Plot summary</span>. <span class="persName">Little Jack</span> is a foundling adopted by an <span class="persName">old man</span>, formerly a soldier, and now living on a “wide uncultivated moor” where he has built
                                 a hut and grows his own vegetables (p. 3). Although poor, he is content, having “‘avoided,
                                 perhaps, many faults, and much uneasiness, which I should have incurred had I been
                                 in another situation” (p. 19). He owns “one domestic” and “friend” (pp. 4–5), a goat
                                 named <span class="persName">Little Nan</span>, which he rescued as a kid. Finding the infant likewise abandoned on the moor, the
                                 <span class="persName">old man</span> trusts “Providence which feeds the birds of the wood and the beasts of the field,
                                 and which has promised to bless all those that are kind and charitable” (p. 6). So
                                 it is that <span class="persName">Nan</span>, having “lost her kid”, willingly suckles the infant, “seem[ing] to adopt him with
                                 equal tenderness as her offspring” (pp. 7, 8). “‘Who knows’”, concludes the <span class="persName">old man</span>, “‘but Providence, which has preserved this child in so wonderful a manner, may have
                                 destined it to something equally wonderful in its future life; and may bless me as
                                 the humble agent of its decrees’” (p. 8).<br/><br/> A Rousseauvian savage, <span class="persName">Little Jack</span> is “left to nature” to grow; and since he is “unfettered by bandages or restraints”
                                 and wears “neither shoes nor stockings, nor shirt”, “his limbs” attain “their due
                                 proportions and form” (pp. 9, 10). A lady passing in her carriage hears his story,
                                 and although she “had seen a great deal of the world, and had read a variety of books,
                                 it had never once entered into her head that a child might grow strong and vigorous
                                 by sucking a goat, instead of eating pap” (p. 14). She offers to take him in, but,
                                 <span class="persName">Jack</span> refusing, gives him money for shoes and stockings. <span class="persName">Jack</span> dutifully attempts to discharge the charity, but finds the shoes so cumbersome that
                                 he uses the money to buy his “daddy” a warm coat instead.<br/><br/> <span class="persName">Jack</span>ʼs daddy teaches him only “plain and simple morals and religion”, so that, when <span class="persName">Nan</span> dies, <span class="persName">Jack</span> is “not able to talk as finely about love, tenderness, and sensibility, as many other
                                 little boys, that have enjoyed greater advantages of education”. Nonetheless, like
                                 <span class="persName">Harry Sandford</span> compared to <span class="persName">Tommy Merton</span>, <span class="persName">Jack</span> feels “the reality” of such emotions “in his heart, and thought it . . . natural
                                 to love every thing that loves us” (p. 13). <span class="persName">Jack</span> has one fault, however, of being “a little too jealous of his honour”, which he is
                                 able to defend with “such dispositions for the art of boxing, that he could beat every
                                 boy in the neighbourhood, of his age and size” (pp. 16–17). (The plate showing <span class="persName">Jack</span> boxing with <span class="persName">Tom the Collier</span> is the only cut that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> did not outline on the reverse.)<br/><br/> When <span class="persName">Jack</span> is twelve, the <span class="persName">old man</span> dies. In his grief, <span class="persName">Jack</span> desperately tries to restore warmth to the corpse by stripping naked and lying atop
                                 him. A local farmer who is acquainted with <span class="persName">Jack</span> takes him in and teaches him farmwork, but the farmer dies as well. <span class="persName">Jack</span> resolutely sets out to find other means to support himself. Chancing on an iron foundry,
                                 he is drawn to its warmth and shelter. The industry contrasts with his agrarian upbringing,
                                 but his straigtforward account of himself leads to a position. Because he is incautiously
                                 open about his history, however, the other boys tease him, provoking <span class="persName">Jack</span> to frequent fistfights. One day, the foundry is toured by gentlemen and ladies. (The
                                 foundry processes are detailed sufficiently to form a brief example of the factory
                                 tour genre.) The visit is interrupted by the disturbance of another fight, causing
                                 the master to threaten <span class="persName">Jack</span> with dismissal. The foreman interjects how <span class="persName">Jack</span> is a dependable workman, and <span class="persName">Jack</span> stoutly defends his behavior, describing how the boys mock his strange upbringing.
                                 While the visitors also cannot restrain their laughter at the story of <span class="persName">Nan</span>, the company happens to include the lady who had heard the story previously and given
                                 him money for shoes. She once again offers to take <span class="persName">Jack</span> into service, and he accepts. “Call him a little soldier, and <span class="persName">Jack</span> was at every oneʼs disposal. This was <span class="persName">Jack</span>ʼs particular foible and vanity”, imitating his daddy, the old soldier, by “poising
                                 a dung‐fork, charging with a broom‐stick, and standing sentry at the stable‐door”
                                 (p. 31). He also developes an “immoderate love of horses” (p. 32); and building on
                                 his experience at the foundry, learns some smithing, sadlery, and carpentry. His resourcefulnesss
                                 makes him useful and entertaining to his mistressʼs orphaned nephew, young <span class="persName">Master Willets</span>. Allowed to be on familiar terms with the boy, <span class="persName">Jack</span> listens to <span class="persName">Master Willets</span>ʼs lessons, and practices writing and studying on his own at night. This happiness
                                 comes to an end when <span class="persName">Master Willets</span> is visited by a young gentleman “with a very great taste for finery, and a supreme
                                 contempt for all the vulgar” (p. 37). The gentleman of course cannot abide <span class="persName">Jack</span>, and <span class="persName">Jack</span> resents the injury to his honor. Happening to acquire a monkey from a showman, <span class="persName">Jack</span> outfits the animal as a parody of the gentleman, inciting the gentlemen to cruelly
                                 slay the monkey and receive a harmless indignity in return. <span class="persName">Jack</span> refuses to apologize, and his “obstinacy” leads to his dismissal (p. 42). Coming
                                 at last to his adoptive fatherʼs profession, <span class="persName">Jack</span> enlists as a marine and is sent to <span class="placeName">India</span>. While pausing to hunt on an island, <span class="persName">Jack</span> is separated from his party and loses his way. Fearing to be treated by the natives
                                 “as the white men generally treat the blacks when they get them into their possession”,
                                 <span class="persName">Jack</span> decides to survive on his own, content to be rid of anyone “‘to quarrel with me,
                                 or baa, or laugh at my poor daddy and mammy [<span class="persName">Nan</span>]’” (pp. 48–49). A brief Robinsonade ensues until <span class="persName">Jack</span> is rescued by an English ship, which carries him to <span class="placeName">India</span>. <span class="persName">Jack</span> serves ably in <span class="placeName">India</span>, but when his regiment marches within reach of the “Tartars”, he warns the officers
                                 to avoid these warriorsʼ calvary skills. His warnings are ignored, resulting in the
                                 armyʼs routing. <span class="persName">Jack</span> is taken among the hostages, though “he alone, accustomed to all the vicissitudes
                                 of life, retain[s] his chearfulness, and [is] prepared to meet every reverse of fortune”
                                 (p. 56). The narrator supplies an anthropological account of the Tartars, preparing
                                 to show how <span class="persName">Jack</span> ingratiates himself by means of his horsemanship. He draws on his smithing to introduce
                                 the Tartars to shoeing their horses, on his sadlery to improve the Tartarsʼ gear,
                                 and on his regard for animals to train the Tartarsʼ horses for docility without violence.
                                 When the English negotiate freedom for the hostages, the Tartars present <span class="persName">Jack</span> with valuable presents. Returned to the English camp, he secures an honorable discharge.
                                 Back in <span class="placeName">England</span>, <span class="persName">Jack</span> returns to the iron foundry as a foreman, and ends as a partner. He buys the moor
                                 where the <span class="persName">old man</span> found him and <span class="persName">Nan</span>, and on the site of the <span class="persName">old man</span>ʼs hut he builds a “small but convenient house” where “he would sometimes retire from
                                 business, and cultivate his garden with his own hands, for he hated idleness”. He
                                 now freely relates his history without fear of mockery, since “it is of very little
                                 consequence how a man comes into the world, provided he behaves well, and discharges
                                 his duty when he is in it” (pp. 64, 65).</li>

In <span class="date">1823</span>, to mollify <span class="persName">John</span> during an illness, <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> was “obliged to buy I donʼt know how many books”. Worried that <span class="persName">John James</span> might duplicate a purchase, she recommended he bring home this traditional ballad
                                 along with <span class="titlem">“Sinbad the Sailor”</span> (<span class="titlem">Margaret to John James Ruskin, <span class="date">11 March 1823</span></span>, <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 126–27 and see 127 n. 1). No further indication appears in the family letters whether
                                 <span class="titlem">“Children of the Wood”</span> was acquired or, if so, in what edition. The tale was widely familiar to child readers,
                                 but in starkly differing versions.<br/><br/> The original ballad relates how a dying man and his wife commend their young son
                                 and daughter to the care of the manʼs brother. After a year of caring for the children,
                                 the uncle succumbs to the temptation to steal their inheritance, and hires assassins
                                 to convey the children to a wood and murder them. One of the would‐be killers has
                                 a change of heart and, to avert the deed, kills his partner, but then abandons the
                                 children to die of starvation and exposure in the wood. Their bodies are covered with
                                 leaves by a robin.<br/><br/> The ballad first appeared in print in <span class="date">1595</span> and long held popular appeal in broadside form, before becoming an object of antiquarian
                                 interest when included in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Reliques of Ancient English Poetry</span></span> compiled by <span class="persName">Thomas Percy</span> (<span class="date">1765</span>). <span class="persName">Patricia Crain</span> has traced the balladʼs “life as a printed text and its migration from the ballad
                                 canon to the childrenʼs literature canon” in the <span class="date">late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries</span>—the point at which <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> perceived the story as appropriate comfort for an ailing four year old. As <span class="persName">Crain</span> explains, these “genre and format transformations” from popular broadside to a childrenʼs
                                 book “converse[d] and coordinate[d] with shifting views and valuations of childrenʼs
                                 lives and deaths”. By <span class="date">1823</span>, the texts and illustrations designed for child readers, which would have been available
                                 to the Ruskins, included a prose revision by a pseudonymous <span class="persName">“Clara English”</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Children in the Wood: An Instructive Tale</span></span> (<span class="date">1801</span>), published by <span class="orgName">Darton and Harvey</span>. In this version, the childrenʼs death and avian burial are replaced by their rescue
                                 and training for useful work in a utopian manufacturing town (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#CRAINREADINGCHILDREN"><span class="persName">Crain</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Reading Children</span></span></a>, 44, 50–51). In another prose version, presented as a “continuation” of the story,
                                 <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Perfidy Detected! or, The Children in the Wood Restored, by Honestas, the Hermit of
                                       the Forest</span></span> (<span class="date">1814</span>), the children wandering in the woods fall into the arms of a kindly hermit, who
                                 has retreated to the forest to mourn the abduction of his own children. Not only are
                                 the children providentially discovered at the hermitage by their father, who is inexplicably
                                 alive; the hermitʼs own lost daughters are revealed and reunited with their father,
                                 as well. At the same time, the original story was preserved in a prose version published
                                 by <span class="persName">William Darton</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Children in the Wood: A Tale for the Nursery</span></span>, featuring a frontispiece showing the childrenʼs corpses strewn with leaves and guarded

See above, Untraced 1, <span class="titlem">“Children of the Wood”</span>, for the possible simultaneous purchase of <span class="titlem">“Sinbad the Sailor”</span> in <span class="date">1823</span>.<br/><br/>  The stories known as <span class="titlem">“Sinbad the Sailor”</span> (or “Sindbad”) form part of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Arabian Nightsʼ Entertainments</span></span>, as the collection was familiarly entitled in <span class="placeName">Britain</span>. In the <span class="date">eighteenth century</span>, English readers were introduced to the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Arabian Nights</span></span> by way of <span class="placeName">France</span>, where <span class="persName">Antoine Galland</span> (<span class="date">1646–1715</span>) translated the stories from Arabic as <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Les Mille et Une Nuits</span></span> (<span class="date">1704–17</span>)—the first English translations based on <span class="persName">Galland</span>ʼs version starting to appear around <span class="date">1706</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALISCHEHERAZADEINENGLAND"><span class="persName">Ali</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scheherazade in England</span></span></a>, 11). In the course of the century, the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sinbad</span></span> tales, like other favorite portions of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Arabian Nights</span></span>, became part of the popular literature that entertained children, though not intended
                                 specifically for them. As <span class="persName">M. O. Grenby</span> characterizes the development of an English childrenʼs canon, popular tales were
                                 not displaced by the new, <span class="date">late eighteenth‐century</span> literature devised especially for children, but absorbed into it (<span class="persName">Grenby</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Child Reader</span></span>, 111, and see 94, 96, 109).<br/><br/> Such assimilation may have came about over the objections of writers with a more
                                 exclusive plan for children—whether plans for practical education like the Edgeworthsʼ
                                 or for religious orthodoxy like <span class="persName">Sarah Trimmer</span>ʼs—but the Arabian Nights tales seem to have been allowed exceptional approval. The
                                 objections by neoclassicists to the extravagance of Eastern tales were countered by
                                 positive comparisons of the <span class="titlem">Sinbad</span> stories to Western classical literature, such as the voyages of <span class="persName">Odysseus</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALISCHEHERAZADEINENGLAND"><span class="persName">Ali</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scheherazade in England</span></span></a>, 22–24). Shifting ground from neoclassical aesthetics altogether, in an essay exploring
                                 how and why readers find pleasure in “well‐wrought scenes of artificial terror . .
                                 . formed by a sublime and vigorous imagination”, <span class="persName">Mrs. Barbauld</span> and <span class="persName">John Aikin</span> considered “the story of <span class="titlem">Aladdin</span> and the travels of <span class="titlem">Sinbad</span> . . . particularly excellent” as “examples of the terrible joined with the marvellous”
                                 (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#AIKINBARBAULDTERROR">Aikin and Aikin, <span class="titlem">“On the Pleasure Derived from Objects of Terror”</span></a>, 125, 126). By the <span class="date">first quarter of the nineteenth century</span>, British essayists nostalgically associated the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Arabian Nightsʼ Entertainments</span></span> with the wonder and enchantment of childhood reading, (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALISCHEHERAZADEINENGLAND"><span class="persName">Ali</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scheherazade in England</span></span></a>, 38–39, 45, 65 n. 40). For the young <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, an attraction to <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sinbad</span></span> might be explained more simply by his love of seafaring, as witnessed by his many
                                 drawings of ships, both sail and steam (see his drawings, e.g., in his copy of <a class="link_ref" href="#LITTLEJACK" title="1"><span class="persName">Day</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Little Jack</span></span></a>, and in his <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 1”</span> and <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2”</span></a>).<br/><br/> According to <span class="persName">David Whitley</span>, the first collection of tales from <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Arabian Nightsʼ Entertainments</span></span> adapted specifically for child readers, “heavily expurgated and moralised”, was published
                                 by <span class="persName">Elizabeth Newbery</span> (<span class="date">1745/46–1821</span>) as <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Oriental Moralist, or The Beauties of the Arabian Nightsʼ Entertainments, Translated

The Reverend Cooperʼs supplementing the tales “with suitable reflections” suggests
                                 the precedent of <span class="persName">Croxall</span>ʼs annotating <span class="titlem">Aesopʼs fables</span> “with Instructive Applications” (see <a class="link_ref" href="#AESOP" title="3">Beinecke 3</a>).

This series was edited for child readers probably by <span class="persName">William Godwin</span> (<span class="date">1756–1836</span>) and the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sinbad</span></span> may have been translated by <span class="persName">Mary Jane Godwin</span>, formerly Mrs. Clairmont and Godwinʼs second wife (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FABLESANDFAIRYTALESSINBADHOCKLIFFE"><span class="titlem">“Fables and Fairy Tales”</span></a>).<br/><br/> <br/><br/> An edition of the entirety of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Arabian Nightsʼ Entertainments</span></span> came into the Ruskin library, according to <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs extant accounts, as a purchase in <span class="date">November 1834</span>: “<span class="titlem">Arabian Nights</span> 27/” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFMS28"><span class="titlem">Account Book</span></a>, 34v; see <span class="ref"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></span>, 286 n. 1). Assuming that this edition was an English translation, the most recent
                                 was <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The New Arabian Nightsʼ Entertainments</span></span>, translated into German by <span class="persName">Jos. von Hammer</span> and, in turn, into English by the <span class="persName">Reverend George Lamb</span>. This version was published in <span class="date">1826</span> by <span class="orgName">Colburn and Bentley</span>, with a second edition appearing in <span class="date">1829</span>. Its advertised price of 18<span style="font-style:italic">s</span> for three small octavo volumes does not, however, match <span class="persName">John James</span>ʼs expenditure of 27<span style="font-style:italic">s</span>. The closest match with this price is a listing of 1£ 8<span style="font-style:italic">s</span> for a four‐volume 12mo, with engraved illustrations by <span class="persName">Richard Westall</span>, share‐published in <span class="date">1819</span> by <span class="persName">J. Booker</span>; <span class="orgName">Baldwin, Cradock, and Joy</span>; <span class="orgName">Rodwell &amp; Martin</span>; and <span class="orgName">G. &amp; W. B. Whittaker</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#LONDONCATALOGUEOFBOOKS1814-46"><span class="titlem">London Catalogue of Books</span> . . . <span class="date">1814 to 1846</span></a>, 16).<br/><br/> In mature writings, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> frequently alluded to the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Sinbad</span></span> stories, especially the story of the <span class="titlem">Valley of Diamonds</span>, on which he based lecture 1, <span class="titlem">“The Valley of Diamonds”</span>, in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Ethics of the Dust</span></span> (<span class="date">1866</span>) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 18:209–20).</li>

                              <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Discussion</span>. On <span class="date">15 May 1827</span>, <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> reported to <span class="persName">John James</span> that <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs “aunt has sent him a neat second hand copy in two Vols of <span class="persName">M Genlis</span> <span class="titlem">Tales of the Castle</span> I mention this lest you might think of buying them” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Burd</span></a>, 166). This was <span class="titlem">Les Veillées du château</span> (<span class="date">1784</span>), by the <span class="persName">comtesse de Genlis</span> (<span class="date">1746–1830</span>), which was translated into English in <span class="date">1785</span> by <span class="persName">Thomas Holcroft</span> (<span class="date">1745–1809</span>). <span class="persName">Burd</span> glosses <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs copy as a publication of <span class="date">1817</span>—not on the basis, it seems, of a known physical copy, but on the evidence of <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs noting “two Vols” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Burd</span></a>, 168 n. 1; see also <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><span class="persName">Dearden</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Library of John Ruskin</span></span></a>, 128 [no. 1004]).<br/><br/> Initially, <span class="persName">Holcroft</span>ʼs translation was published in five volumes, and sometimes four, while a two‐volume
                                 edition appears to have been published only in <span class="date">1816</span> or <span class="date">1817</span>. <span class="orgName">The British Museum</span></li>
