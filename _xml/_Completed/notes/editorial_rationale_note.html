                  <p>For a detailed account of this topic, see <a class="link_ref" href="history_of_bibliography_and_editing_note.php">History of the Bibliography and Editing of Ruskinʼs Early Manuscripts</a>. In the present note, precedents and problems in past approaches are summarized as
                     a foundation for the rationale governing the editorial approach adopted in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>. Past practices include separating genres and disciplines that Ruskin, in his youth,
                     did not necessarily perceive as divided; isolating works from larger corpuses in which
                     Ruskin experimented with anthologizing and recontexualizing those works; and imposing
                     editorial policies with misguided aims of suppressing texts that editors deemed incomplete,
                     while intrusively regularizing and even substantively revising texts that did get
                     selected for publication.</p>
                  <div class="sub-subsection" id="DIVISION">
                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.1.1. </span><span class="head">The Editorial Division of Poetry from Prose</span></h4>
                     <p>The first editors of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early manuscripts divided the archive by genre, poetry from prose. The precedent
                        for this division was set by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs father and his friend, <a class="link_ref" href="harrison_w_h_note.php"><span class="persName">W. H. Harrison</span> (ca. <span class="date">1792–1878</span>)</a>, when they collected a selection of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early verse compositions in the anthology <a class="link_ref" href="poems_1850_note.php"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1850</span>)</span> by <span class="persName">“J.R.”</span></a> For them, the anthology commemorated <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs erstwhile vocation as a poet, an ambition that they had devotedly supported as
                        editors and promoters, but that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> himself had decisively abandoned. Nearly a half‐century later than this first project,
                        the decision to separate the poetry from the prose was maintained by <a class="link_ref" href="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span> (<span class="date">1854–1932</span>)</a> in his edition, <a class="link_ref" href="poems_1891_note.php"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1891</span>)</span></a>. His choice arguably was driven or at least intensified by the cachet that, by the
                        end of the century, had come to surround <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1850</span>)</span> as a scarce collectorʼs item. The heated rare‐book market surrounding the <span class="date">1850</span> volume had already resulted in a pirated American edition of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs poems—one of several piracies that threatened <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs income from his books (see <a class="link_ref" href="poems_1891_note.php#PROVOCATION"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1891</span>)</span>: The Provocation of American Literary Piracy</a>). Animating all this interest in the poems was the charm of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiographical narrative in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Praeterita</span></span> about his youthful career as a poet manqué.</p>
                     <p><span class="persName">Collingwood</span> planned a complementary edition of prose, documenting <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs turn from poetry to criticism. This edition was never realized under <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs editorship. Ultimately, the project was hurriedly and inadequately compiled as
                        the first volume, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Early Prose</span></span>, of the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span>, under the supervision of <a class="link_ref" href="cook_e_t_note.php"><span class="persName">E. T. Cook</span> (<span class="date">1857–1919</span>)</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="wedderburn_note.php"><span class="persName">Alexander Wedderburn</span> (<span class="date">1854–1931</span>)</a>. To a significant extent, that volume merely collected recent editions of early prose
                        works that <a class="link_ref" href="allen_george_note.php"><span class="persName">George Allen</span> (<span class="date">1832–1907</span>)</a> had revived, more with a view to producing handsome volumes for the collectorsʼ market
                        and thwarting sales of American piracies, than with a serious scholarly purpose (see
                        <a class="link_ref" href="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>).</p>
                     <p>While these editorial decisions were influenced by the market, the editions did not
                        entirely lack scholarly merit, but their bibliographical underpinnings were flawed
                        by the foundational decision to segregate poetry from prose. <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>, who had access to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs study in his home, <span class="placeName">Brantwood</span>, was the first to undertake a descriptive and analytic bibliography of the early
                        verse <span style="font-style:italic">manuscripts</span> (earlier bibliographers had described only the youthful <span style="font-style:italic">publications</span>) and he published his findings as the <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note on the Original MSS. of the Poems”</span>, appended to volume 1 of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1891</span>)</span> (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date">1891</span>]</span></a>,1:261–67; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS8D1891"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> [8<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date">1891</span>]</span></a>, 1:262–68). Whatever bibliographical attention <span class="persName">Collingwood</span> may have given to the prose manuscripts in his preparations, the <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note”</span> was rendered incomplete and lacking in evidence, owing to arbitrarily omitting entire
                        manuscripts that contain solely prose. Even on its own terms as a bibliography of
                        the poetry manuscripts, the <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note”</span> is problematic in neglecting to describe or explain prose works present in several
                        of the manuscripts that the note does describe—or even to describe prose included
                        <span style="font-style:italic">as part of</span> works composed primarily in verse.</p>
                     <p>In the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a>, <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> addressed the problems raised by this division only imperfectly. The editors maintained
                        <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs scheme of housing works separately by genre in the volumes, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Early Prose</span></span> and <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span></span> (volumes 1 and 2, respectively), but in the prose volume they did not attempt to
                        match <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note”</span> for the poetry with a corresponding bibliographical description of the prose manuscripts.
                        Rather, in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Early Prose</span></span> they hastily repackaged existing republications of early prose writings made in the
                        <span class="date">1890s</span> by <span class="persName">George Allen</span> along with their scanty bibliograpical notes. In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span></span>, volume 2 of the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span>, the editors reprinted <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note”</span>, expanding it only with brief descriptions of some additional verse manuscripts,
                        and with lists by title of the individual verse works contained in the manuscripts—a
                        useful enough enhancement, so far as it went, but failing to question the fundamental
                        logic or serviceability of separating the poetry manuscripts from the prose in the
                        first place (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></span></a>, 2:529–41).</p>
                     <p>As <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> organized the manuscripts that they found at <span class="placeName">Brantwood</span> during preparation of the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span>, their curatorship of the early manuscripts was based on the same arbitrary distinction.
                        They separately bound some that contained texts of early prose exclusively, while
                        gathering stray poems (including, inconsistently, some early prose) in <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IA</span></a>. They relegated description of the prose manuscripts (or some of them) to volume
                        38, the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Bibliography</span></span> volume of the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span>, classifying these descriptions as “Juvenilia”—leaving open the question of what
                        should be comprised under that term, if not also the early poetry manuscripts listed
                        separately in the <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note”</span>. Thus, <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs editorial scheme—which, if flawed in its logic, had at least beeen carried out
                        consistently and reasonably accurately—was now also confused by inconsistency and
                        unevenness of bibliographical description and editorial procedure in the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span>.</p>
                     <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, rather than perpetuating the late nineteenth‐century conceptualization of the early
                        manuscripts in terms of a vocational watershed between poetry and prose, our ambition
                        is to organize the archive around a creatively dynamic tension perceivable throughout
                        the early writing—a tension, less between poetry and prose than between a unitary
                        work, whether in verse or prose, and its potential to join and alter a larger anthology
                        or collection, and also a dynamism between traditional genres and their potential
                        to join with others to form a composite. In the manuscripts of the <span class="date">1820s</span> known to the Ruskin family as the <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php">Red Books</a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> projected his prose compositions as “volumes” of <span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span>, intended as an ongoing multi‐volume series, while filling out each of these “volumes”
                        with poems collected into small anthologies. Later, he advanced beyond volumes that
                        compiled multiple genres to design unitary works as multi‐genre anthologies in themselves,
                        as in the <a class="link_ref" href="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a> (<span class="date">1833–34</span>)—a work initially composed as a travelogue solely in verse, and then re‐conceived
                        as a composite‐genre travelogue in verse, prose, and picture. Thus, in his youth,
                        while <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> learned to observe conventional generic boundaries in many of his poetic, scientific,
                        and theological manuscripts, he was also constantly intrigued by their dynamic interrelatedness.
                        To represent this dynamism of container and contained, we exploit the 〈teiCorpus〉
                        element of the <span class="orgName">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</span> markup, which can describe <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs nested structures, albeit somewhat imperfectly (see <a class="link_ref" href="#TEICORPUS" title="teiCorpus Markup and the Tension between Works and Corpora">〈teiCorpus〉 Markup and the Tension between Works and Corpora</a>).</p>

                        from an aesthetic preference for forms found in various documents over forms with
                        historical integrity derived from the fact that they are contained in a single document”
                        (as preferred in a documentary orientation) (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SHILLINGSBURGSCHOLARLYEDITING"><span class="persName">Shillingsburg</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Scholarly Editing</span></span></a>, 20). In fact, many of <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs choices appear to have resulted, not from systematic emendation at all, but from
                        the vagaries of his personal taste.</p>
                     <p>The nineteenth‐century editors of the <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> juvenilia apparently took for granted that readers would benefit by an editorial
                        approach that was almost the opposite of documenting an artifact. From <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName">W. H. Harrison</span> to <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>, and to <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span>, the first editors of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early writing freely and without acknowledgment regularized punctuation, invented
                        titles, rewrote lines and reorganized stanzas of poetry, and joined fragments that
                        are unrelated in the manuscripts to form texts that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> never wrote (see <a class="link_ref" href="history_of_bibliography_and_editing_note.php">History of the Bibliography and Editing of the Early Ruskin Manuscripts</a>). In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, these heavily edited texts are themselves treated diplomatically as witnesses to
                        this aesthetic and biographical conception of editing <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs youthful writing, bearing evidentiary value for how editors of the <span class="date">1830s</span> believed the boy should be “brought forward” as an author, and for how editors of
                        the <span class="date">1880s and 1890s</span> perpetuated the mythology of boyhood that, by that time, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> had formed in his autobiographical writing.</p>

                     <p><span class="persName">Professor Burd</span> generously granted permission for this edition to be incorporated into <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, so long as his editionʼs format was maintained in exact integrity (<span class="titlem">Burd to David C. Hanson, <span class="date">28 August 2008</span></span>). Since this condition mandates page images of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, which remains widely available in book form, and since the outstanding quality of
                        <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs editing would not justify a new transcription and annotation of the letters, there
                        is no call at present to join the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Letters</span></span> with <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>. The digital archive does, however, make available manuscript facsimiles of letters
                        containing works (such as poems or parts of poems), since these witnesses are necessary
                        to the editing of these works in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>. Facsimiles of some other family letters are also included as evidence of material
                        aspects of handwriting, media, and so on.</p>
                     <p><span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> re‐edits works that <span class="persName">Burd</span> included in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></span> on the grounds of their epistolary presentation. Such works include <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs presentation copies of <a class="link_ref" href="new_years_poems_note.php">New Yearʼs Poems</a> and birthday odes for his <span class="persName">father</span>. <span class="persName">Burd</span> edited only the presentation versions of those works, without attempting comparison
                        or collation with drafts and other fair copies.</p>
                     <p>Another previously published edition of an early <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> manuscript is <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRTOURLAKES"><span class="titlem">A Tour to the Lakes in Cumberland</span></a>, the account of the joint travel diary by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> and his cousin, <span class="persName">Mary Richardson</span>, edited by <span class="persName">James S.

Since this <span class="date">1830</span> manuscript provides important evidence about such matters as collaborative writing
                        in the Ruskin family, and the developing relation for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> between travel and writing, this edition, like <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, will be gratefully referenced and discussed throughout <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, while it is hoped that the diary can be re‐edited in keeping with <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>ʼs editorial method.</p>

For the biography, see the account by <span class="persName">James L.

While working in archives, <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> transcribed numerous early texts by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>; and at an early stage of research for <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, the editor benefited from consulting these typescript transcriptions, whether as

None of these transcriptions are used as copytext in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, since they are limited in their usefulness owing to mistranscriptions arising from
                        the speed with which <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> had to cover an extensive territory. <span class="persName">Viljoen</span>ʼs unpublished critical papers on the early writing do remain helpful, however, and

                     <p>Chronologically, a starting point for the scope of works edited in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> would appear easily determined by the earliest available manuscripts in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand. However, the elusiveness of determining beginnings of a <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> archive is suggested by the decisions of <span class="persName">Helen Gill Viljoen</span>, whose interest in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early writings drove her farther back in time to his “Scottish heritage” in order
                        to understand <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents. The personalities and influence of <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> and <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>, <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> believed, were foundational to an understanding of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> as a writer (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#SCOTTISHHERITAGE"><span class="persName">Viljoen</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskinʼs Scottish Heritage</span></span></a>). Similarly, <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span>ʼs <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span> begins with the courtship correspondence between <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents, along with their exchanges with their parents. While the present editor
                        is entirely sympathetic to researching <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs juvenilia in context of his parentsʼ writing (see, e.g., <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HANSONMATERIALITY"><span class="persName">Hanson</span>, <span class="titlem">“Materiality in John Ruskinʼs Early Letters and Dialogues”</span></a>), <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> is not meant to duplicate either <span class="persName">Viljoen</span>ʼs bibliographical research or <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span>ʼs annotation of the family correspondence, but rather to complement these resources,
                        gratefully referencing them through commentary. <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> seeks also to contribute a standard of documentary editing in digital format for
                        <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs boyhood and youthful writing. Accordingly, the logical terminus a quo for the chronological
                        inclusion of manuscripts lies with <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs earliest extant poem, which we argue to be <a class="link_ref" href="the_needless_alarm_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Needless Alarm”</span></a>, fair‐copied in <span class="date">1826</span>. Possibly earlier markings by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> that survive inside of printed books owned by the family are discussed in <a class="link_ref" href="boyhood_books_note.php#DESCRIPTIONS">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions</a>).</p>
                     <p>As a terminus ad quem for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early writing, the editors of the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span> chose the publication of <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Modern Painters I</span></span>, since the emerging biographical consensus followed <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs autobiography in perceiving <span class="date">1843</span> as the debut of his destined professional role as a critic. <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span> likewise chose to close <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></span> in <span class="date">June 1843</span>, when <span class="titlem">the first volume of <span style="font-style:italic">Modern Painters</span></span> appeared. <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> follows suit, but the aim respecting questions of scope should not be settled by
                        precedent without also interrogating the basis of those precedents.</p>

                        Paradoxically, in the case of juvenilia, attempts to define and circumscribe the scope
                        of a body of early writing can undermine the perceived value of the editorial project.
                        As <span class="persName">Alexander</span> and <span class="persName">McMaster</span> comment, establishing an end‐point of an authorʼs “apprentice” work tends to reflect
                        backward on the early writing in negative terms, owing to pejorative connotations
                        of the terms used to characterize the writing, including the term <span style="font-style:italic">juvenilia</span> itself. For example, the separation between the <span class="orgName">Brontë sistersʼ</span> early writing and the novels has often been approached as a “problem” in a derogatory
                        sense, with the <span style="font-style:italic">juvenile</span> understood to persist as a kind of lingering debilitation into the later work. <span class="persName">Branwell Brontë</span> (<span class="date">1817–48</span>) has been held up as exemplifying what happens if the juvenile as a source of weakness
                        is never rejected by the author, leading critics to categorize the entirety of his
                        creative work as “juvenilia”, despite his having produced creative writing continuously
                        until his death at age thirty‐one (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERMCMASTERINTRODUCTION"><span class="persName">Alexander</span> and <span class="persName">McMaster</span>,<span class="titlem">“Introduction”</span></a>, 2; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERDEFINING"><span class="persName">Alexander</span>, <span class="titlem">“Defining and Representing Literary Juvenilia”</span></a>, 71–72). </p>
                     <p>Participants in the conferences of the <span class="orgName">International Society of Literary Juvenilia (ISLJ)</span> have been steadily building the case for defining and studying the genre of juvenilia,
                        and <span class="persName">Laurie Langbauer</span> in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#LLJUVENILETRADITION"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Juvenile Tradition</span></span></a> has traced child writing as a literary historical phenomenon from the eighteenth
                        through the early nineteenth centuries. Although <span class="date">nineteenth‐century</span> writers may seem themselves to have sanctioned a moralistic and negative assessment
                        of their early writing, characterizing their transition away from juvenilia as a righteous
                        rite of passage, <span class="persName">Kate E. Brown</span>, among others, has revealed considerable complexity in this imaginary, by re‐examining
                        how <span class="persName">Charlotte Brontë</span> (<span class="date">1816–55</span>) thought about her transition from <span style="font-style:italic">juvenilia</span> to the novel, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Professor</span></span> (composed ca. <span class="date">1844–46</span>; published <span class="date">1857</span>). By characterizing this novel in its preface as a “little book”, <span class="persName">Brontë</span> emphasized its material form (she contended for a single‐volume publication, contrary
                        to publishersʼ three‐volume standard). By dwelling on the novelʼs smallness, <span class="persName">Brontë</span>ʼs preface works to connect <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Professor</span></span> with the juvenilia—distinctively, a collection of little books in their material
                        form—more than the preface disassociates the novel from early writing. As <span class="persName">Brontë</span> writes: “A first attempt it [the novel] certainly was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span>, as the pen which wrote it had been previously worn a good deal in a practice of
                        some years”—an assertion of the continuity of the writing life that is again figured
                        in terms of material associations, the worn pen. At the same time, <span class="persName">Brontë</span> falls into the defensive reflex of denigrating the value of the juvenilia, by erasing
                        its existence as quickly as she invokes it, claiming to have “destroyed almost as
                        soon as” she created these earlier “crude effort[s]”. (That claim was false, but at
                        the time of the ca. <span class="date">1851</span> preface, the miniature <span class="persName">Brontë</span> juvenilia were unknown outside the family; and as <span class="persName">Brown</span> remarks, <span class="persName">Charlotte</span> had grown secretive about the little books and the sagas they contained, wary even
                        of mentioning them to close friends. The miniature manuscripts came to light publicly
                        after <span class="persName">Charlotte</span>ʼs death, when her husband briefly entrusted a “packet” of the manuscripts to <span class="persName">Elizabeth Gaskell</span>, who then described them in her <span class="date">1857</span> <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Life of Charlotte Brontë</span></span>.) <span class="persName">Brown</span> links the secrecy with which <span class="persName">Charlotte</span> enshrouded the juvenile manuscripts, along with their distinctive materiality, with
                        the episode in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Villette</span></span> (<span class="date">1853</span>) in which <span class="persName">Lucy Snowe</span> preserves letters from <span class="persName">John Bretton</span> by sealing and burying them beneath the roots of the “nunʼs tree”. Such actions invest
                        the written artifacts with significance as “beloved objects”, which, <span class="persName">Brown</span> argues, are not repudiated but disavowed. “Repudiation seeks to obviate a loss by
                        claiming it as oneʼs own desire, rejecting the lost object of love in an effort to
                        restore self‐esteem. . . . [D]isavowal offers more contradictory satisfactions: it
                        both denies and accedes to loss so as to perpetuate grief”, allowing “for two mutually
                        exclusive responses to coexist”—namely, responding to loss by “at once memorializing
                        a lost love” in the beloved object and by “denying its loss” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BRONTEPROFESSOR"><span class="persName">Brontë</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Professor</span></span></a>, ed. <span class="persName">Smith</span> and <span class="persName">Rosengarten</span>, 3 [preface]; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#BROWNBELOVEDOBJECTS"><span class="persName">Brown</span>, <span class="titlem">“Beloved Objects”</span></a>, 397–98, 417 n. 11; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#GASKELLLIFEOFBRONTE"><span class="persName">Gaskell</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Life of Charlotte Brontë</span></span></a>, ed. <span class="persName">Jay</span>, 62 [chap. 5]).</p>
                     <p>This interpretation highlights one of doubtless many ways in which self‐declared rites
                        of passage in a writerʼs life erect divisions that can be both evaluative and ambivalent,
                        making “almost a genre” of the writerʼs youthful creations. In <span class="date">1845</span>, when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> distanced himself from his poetry—during his first study‐trip to <span class="placeName">Italy</span> on his own, without his parents as fellow travellers, allowing him confidence to
                        sever poetry publication in the literary annuals—disavowal in <span class="persName">Brown</span>ʼs sense contested repudiation. Repeatedly invoking <span class="persName">Wordsworth</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Intimations Ode”</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> granted himself authority to accept alleged loss (of his feeling for the picturesque)
                        and to welcome compensatory gain (of his newfound critical mission). Buried within
                        his newly urgent critical mission to preserve the monuments of <span class="placeName">Italy</span>, however, lay an ambivalent disavowal of what that poetry had represented and contained,
                        a disavowal that manifested in fetishization of the stone effigy of a child in <span class="placeName">Lucca Cathedral</span>, <span class="titlem">Ilaria del Carretto</span> by <span class="persName">Jacopo della Quercia</span> (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliograpghy.php#HANSONRUSKIN1830S"><span class="persName">Hanson</span>, <span class="titlem">“Ruskin in the 1830s”</span></a>, 151–54).</p>

                  <p>Juvenilia and youthful writing as a field of study privileges a documentary editorial
                     methodology over an eclectic approach. The aim of documentary editing, as summarized
                     by <span class="persName">Mary‐Jo Kline</span> and <span class="persName">Susan Holbrook Perdue</span>, is to represent “artifacts inscribed on paper or a similar medium . . . whose unique
                     physical characteristics and original nature give them special evidentiary value”
                     (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#KLINEPERDUEDOCUMENTARY"><span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Documentary Editing</span></a>, 3). In the <span class="date">mid‐1980s</span>, writing in the first edition of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Documentary Editing</span></span>, <span class="persName">Kline</span> could still generalize about a contrast between the documentary approach of historians
                     and the “literary editing” theorized and practiced by textual critics and editors
                     in English departments. In that same decade, however, such scholars as <span class="persName">Donald McKenzie</span> and <span class="persName">Jerome McGann</span> began to sway literary scholars toward a more sociological approach focused on study
                     of the textual artifact in its cultural moment. Historians came meanwhile to recognize
                     that, in their allegedly purist views of documentary editing, they had tended to overlook
                     their own interventionist and “literary” practices (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#KLINEPERDUEDOCUMENTARY"><span class="persName">Kline</span> and <span class="persName">Perdue</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Documentary Editing</span></span></a>, 4–25; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#TANSELLEHISTORICISM"><span class="persName">Tanselle</span>, <span class="titlem">“Historicism and Critical Editing”</span></a>). The study of juvenilia foregrounds the merits that historians have traditionally
                     claimed for diplomatic editing of manuscript documents while also highlighting the
                     difficulties of achieving purity in a diplomatic method.</p>
                  <p>Even before the advent of sociological approaches to literary editing, twentieth‐century
                     editing of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> swung to a documentary method, prompted in part by <a class="link_ref" href="viljoen_h_g_note.php"><span class="persName">Helen Gill Viljoen</span></a>ʼs scorn for the inconsistencies and haphazard methods of <span class="persName">E. T. Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Alexander Wedderburn</span> in the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a>. <span class="persName">Viljoen</span> was less willing to point out similar faults in <span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span>ʼs practices, whereas arguably the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span> can be credited with favoring a more consistently historical approach than <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs, given <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span>ʼs policy of printing unpublished materials, albeit selectively and in heavily edited
                     versions. In any case, a diplomatic approach to transcribing <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> manuscripts became the norm with the editorial labors of <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span>. Victorian studies was influenced by <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs <span class="date">1973</span> edition, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, which comprehensively collected the entire familyʼs historical papers—the <span style="font-style:italic">family</span> letters—as requisite to scholarship, rather than limiting the published correspondence
                     to <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs side, narrowly viewed as a literary accomplishment. <span class="persName">Burd</span> also attempted faithfully to reproduce the idiosyncrasies of the Ruskinsʼ punctuation,
                     recognizing how the pulse of thought can be revealed in the hand. The reader is treated
                     as a confidante, comprehending the fullness of the family conversation, and brought
                     closer to the young <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs responsive thought and feeling. As <span class="persName">Sheila Emerson</span> observes, the frequent lack of punctuation in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early writing provides reflects how he “bound his phrases each to each” and allowed
                     “their movement [to jam] back and forth in the mind” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#EMERSONGENESISOFINVENTION">Emerson, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Genesis of Invention</span></span></a>, 27). This view was shared even by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs mother, <span class="persName">Margaret</span>, who “let <span class="persName">John</span>s letters come just as he writes them”, as she explained to <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> when enclosing their sonʼs letters inside her own, in order “that you may not be
                     misled in your judgment as to his hopes and feelings” (<a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1829-03-04_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">4 March 1829</span></span></a>, in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, ed., <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 1:185).</p>
                  <p>Perhaps <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs most passionate statement of this approach occurs in his edition of the <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WINNINGTONLETTERS"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Winnington Letters</span></span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs letters to the schoolmistress, <span class="persName">Margaret Alexis Bell</span>, and the girls at <span class="placeName">Winnington Hall</span>. <span class="persName">Burd</span> urges that no edited substitute ultimately can capture the experience of reading
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in manuscript, where syntax and punctuation “convey clearly the flow of his ideas
                     and spirit at the moment of writing. His punctuation, while unconventional, is logical
                     and expressive of the pause, pitch, and stress of his sentences”. <span class="persName">Burd</span> admits doubt “that print can reproduce the individuality of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs punctuation”; and after a long paragraph entrancingly describing the meaning of
                     every eccentric stroke, his regret is palpable that any endeavor by an editor “to
                     make the transcription of . . . [<span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs] punctuation as accurate as printing will permit” can result only in a pale reflection
                     of the experience of reading a <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> letter in manuscript. The most exacting documentary transcription, <span class="persName">Burd</span> declares, can “never record the story told by his handwriting, which often reflects
                     his moods”, and he defies the “printed page [to] convey the pleasure of opening .
                     . . [<span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs] 4½ by 2½ inch envelopes, or unfolding his 4½ by 7 inch (often double) sheets of
                     blue, grey, or cream stationery” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WINNINGTONLETTERSINTRO"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, <span class="titlem">introduction to <span style="font-style:italic">The Winnington Letters</span></span></a>, 84–87).</p>
                  <p>In his edition of the Ruskin family letters, which followed four years later, <span class="persName">Burd</span> maintained his practice of a documentary system of transcription, but with a justification
                     that was advanced in more historicized terms than the hope, as expressed in the <span class="titlem">introduction to <span style="font-style:italic">The Winnington Letters</span></span>, of bringing the reader “close to the flat table on which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> wrote”; rather, <span class="persName">Burd</span> more laconically proposed “to preserve for the reader the pleasure of discovering
                     . . . [the] original flavor” of the Ruskinsʼ correspondence, by resisting the editorial
                     impulse to impose “a formality [of regularization] which the writers never intended—and
                     to which some of them were never educated” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WINNINGTONLETTERSINTRO"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, <span class="titlem">introduction to <span style="font-style:italic">The Winnington Letters</span></span></a>, 88; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFLINTRO"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, <span class="titlem">introduction to <span style="font-style:italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>, 1:xlv).</p>
                  <p>In the evolution of <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs justification of a diplomatic approach to manuscript transcription—first appealing
                     to re‐creation of an intimacy with a writer, and later arguing for a historical rationale—his
                     editions reflect a longer trend in manuscript and book collecting. Late‐Victorian
                     collectors sought first editions by “modern” (i.e., nineteenth‐century) writers in
                     the belief that the physical book produced closest in time to the authorʼs composition
                     carried a personal connection with a writer. In manuals on book collecting, this “sentiment”
                     borne by first editions was figuratively expressed, as it later was by <span class="persName">Burd</span> in his most enthusiastic writing, as if following the authorʼs hand on his writing
                     table. Subsequently, the New Bibliographers of the <span class="date">1930s</span> rejected such sentiment in favor of more “objective” approaches (see <a class="link_ref" href="collecting_of_modern_authors_note.php">Collecting of Modern Authors in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</a>; and <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#HANSONSENTIMENTANDMATERIALITY">Hanson, “Sentiment and Materiality in Late‐Victorian Book Collecting”</a>). In <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> studies, a sentiment of intimacy with the author through collecting or manuscript
                     study seems to have persisted longer, perhaps because <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> himself sought such immediacy of connection with audiences by commenting on the materiality
                     of writing, whether as dramatized in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Fors Claivigera</span></span> as the act of writing thwarted by piercing steam whistles, or as represented in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Praeterita</span></span> by a facsimile of his boyhood writing for whatever it might reveal about his youth.
                     Added to this encouragement by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> in his published work to think about his writing as a physical act was the historical
                     accident of manuscripts remaining at <span class="placeName">Brantwood</span> for discovery by <span class="persName">Helen Gill Viljoen</span> prior to their dispersal in the estate sales—an experience that made her suspect
                     of any form of editorial intervention that might operate as a conspiracy against <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs ideas. Likewise <span class="persName">Burd</span>, at least at the start of his career in the <span class="titlem">introduction to <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Winnington Letters</span></span></span>, jumps quickly from the record of past editorsʼ attempts to regularize <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs punctuation and grammar to an accusation that what past editors truly sought was
                     to suppress (quoting <span class="persName">Charles Eliot Norton</span>) the “‘too personal, too intimate, or of too slight interest’” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#WINNINGTONLETTERSINTRO"><span class="persName">Burd</span>, <span class="titlem">introduction to <span style="font-style:italic">Winnington Letters</span></span></a>, 85).</p>
                  <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, which is able to present electronic facsimiles alongside diplomatic transcriptions
                     of the text, the claim is not to bring the reader even closer to the moment of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs production of manuscripts at his writing table. Since the era of the New Bibliographers,
                     the widening access to manuscripts via ever more spectacularly vivid digitization
                     has brought only renewed skepticism about creating the illusion of reproducing the
                     real thing. In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, our aim is neither to accuse manuscript studies or first‐edition collecting of “sentimentality”
                     nor to defend the “aura” of objects; rather, in annotation and markup of transcriptions

                     alongside digital facsimiles where possible, our aim is to realize a model that, as
                     <span class="persName">Elena Pierazzo</span> urges, proves “useful when it is used for the purpose for which it is built” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#PIERAZZODIGITALSCHOLARLYEDITING"><span class="persName">Pierazzo</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Digital Scholarly Editing</span></span></a>, 96, and see 93–96). That purpose, among other things, is to facilitate study of
                     how, on the one hand, the Ruskin family <span style="font-style:italic">believed</span> <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs “hopes and feelings” to be inscribed in his physical strokes on paper as well as
                     through his text; and of how, on the other hand, he often meant his punctuation, many
                     orthographic styles, and other aspects of presentation to reflect, less his inner
                     world, than the print and pictorial culture surrounding him, in an era as visually
                     stimulating as our own.</p>

                  <p>In expressing both his inner and outer worlds, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> thought about text in a manner that included the materiality of its presentation.
                     Like many nineteenth‐century young authors, he modeled his textual production on published
                     texts. In the earliest extant extended prose work of juvenilia, “Volume I” of his
                     <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span></a> (<span class="date">1826–27</span>) <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Harry and Lucy Concluded; Being the Last Part of Early Lessons</span></span> by <a class="link_ref" href="edgeworth_maria_note.php"><span class="persName">Maria Edgeworth</span> (<span class="date">1768–1849</span>)</a>, while asserting his agency on the title page as the “little boy” who had “printed
                     and composed” and “also drawn” the work.</p>
                  <p>Pursuing his physical imitation to small typographical features, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> invented marks that present the digital encoder with odd challenges in markup. For
                     example, in order to fully justify his hand‐printed text on the right as well as left
                     margins, as in a printed book, he invented an end‐of‐line mark that resembles a hyphen,
                     but that varies in length according to what he needed to fill out the measure of a
                     line, where words fell short of the right‐justified margin. (<span class="persName">Ruskin</span> continued employing this end‐of‐line mark as late as <span class="date">1834–35</span> in his most elaborate and sophisticated imitation of the print culture of illustrated
                     travel literature, the <a class="link_ref" href="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</a> of his <a class="link_ref" href="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>.) To encode this mark as a hyphen would be misleading (particularly since he also
                     used hyphens at the ends of some lines to divide syllables across the break), whereas
                     to ignore the mark altogether would be implicitly to assert that the materiality of
                     text has no bearing on how we study and think about the youthful productions of nineteenth‐century
                     authors. In this instance, <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> uses the <span class="orgName">TEI</span> glyph element, 〈g〉, assigning it the @type “justification”. This is an interpretation,
                     not a neutrally objective encoding of horizontal strokes occurring at the ends of
                     lines, but documentary editing that is innocent of editorial interpretation is neither
                     possible nor desirable, if the purpose is to understand how Ruskin both appropriated
                     the appearance of print and constrained his invention to obey its rules (see <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#PIERAZZODIGITALSCHOLARLYEDITING"><span class="persName">Pierazzo</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Digital Scholarly Editing</span></span></a>, 101). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early manuscripts are already interpretations, in presenting themselves as “printed”
                     works. In cases of punctuation marks too enigmatic to interpret, the recurring pattern
                     is assigned markup and annotated with a provisional explanation, but no definitive
                     interpretation is imposed. Also, no characters or punctuation marks are ignored that
                     can reasonably be inferred as intentional. Even if we must temporize about how to
                     interpret and encode what we see, we avoid the inefficiency of passing over puzzling
                     transcription to be captured later (see <a class="link_ref" href="#TRANSCRIPTION" title="Transcription and Markup Protocol">Transcription and Encoding Procedures</a>).</p>

                  <p>In <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Study of Modern Manuscripts</span></span>, <span class="persName">Donald Reiman</span> recommends that editors “use different procedures for analyzing and editing private
                     and confidential manuscripts from those they employ in presenting public documents”
                     <span class="persName">Reiman</span> defines these three categories, not by the depth of intimacy between writer and reader,
                     nor by the intricacy of artfulness in the writing, but by “the nature and extent of
                     the writerʼs intended audience. A manuscript is <span style="font-style:italic">private</span> if its author intended it to be read only by one person or a specific small group
                     of people whose identity he knew in advance; <span style="font-style:italic">confidential</span> if it was intended for a predefined but larger audience who may—or may not—be personally
                     known to or interested in the author; and <span style="font-style:italic">public</span> only if it was written to be published or circulated for perusal by a widespread,
                     unspecified audience, including such abstractions as the nation, the reading public,
                     and posterity” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#REIMANMODERNMANUSCRIPTS"><span class="persName">Reiman</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Study of Modern Manuscripts</span></span></a>, 43, 65).</p>
                  <p>As an example of a problematic editorial procedure that can arise from ignoring these
                     distinctions between the private, confidential, and public, <span class="persName">Reiman</span> points to nineteenth‐century editions of poems by <span class="persName">Percy Bysshe Shelley</span> (<span class="date">1792–1822</span>) that were arranged “primarily by chronology, rather than by the authorʼs intentions”.
                     This organization resulted in indiscriminate mixing of <span class="persName">Shelley</span>ʼs “false starts and rejected fragments”, which “<span class="persName">Mary Shelley</span> (<span class="date">1797–1851</span>) had so assiduously rescued from his draft notebooks”, with his “highly polished
                     completed poems (with a few fragments) that [the poet had] released for publication”.
                     As a consequence, readers of these chronologically ordered editions inadvertently
                     developed “a less positive picture of <span class="persName">Shelley</span>ʼs intelligence” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#REIMANMODERNMANUSCRIPTS"><span class="persName">Reiman</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Study of Modern Manuscripts</span></span></a>, 43, 53–54).</p>
                  <p>Which of these categories of <span style="font-style:italic">private</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">confidential</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic">public</span> applies to juvenilia and youthful writing? Juvenilia often imitate public forms by
                     mimicking the appearance of published documents, yet the audience is normally confined
                     to the family circle. <span class="persName">Reiman</span> considers a case of manuscript juvenilia, <span class="persName">Jane Austen</span>ʼs (<span class="date">1775–1817</span>) <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Volume the First</span></span> (begun ca. <span class="date">1786–87</span>), and proposes a special subcategory, “<span style="font-style:italic">polished</span> private and confidential manuscripts”, which takes into account the conditions of
                     authorship that developed during the <span class="date">nineteenth‐century</span> “age of printing”. Professional authors in the nineteenth century came to realize
                     “that their final manuscripts were way stations on the road to a perfected text, rather
                     than the thing itself”; accordingly, “the manuscript no longer carried the same textual
                     authority that it once had, even when it represented the authorʼs final involvement
                     in such matters as the orthography and punctuation of most of the text”. Authors in
                     the age of print sent “their work to press . . . anticipating—and in many cases hoping—that
                     changes in the text or its presentation [would] be introduced by the printers or the
                     publishers”. Not so, manuscript “poems or other compositions that were intended for
                     the perusal of a few specific individuals—in short, <span style="font-style:italic">private</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">confidential</span> documents”—that the author fair‐copied for limited distribution, but did not intend
                     for publication. These kinds of artifacts, which include nineteenth‐century juvenilia,
                     bear authority comparable to that of scribal copies of pre‐modern manuscripts, which
                     “the writer never expected . . . to be superseded by a more authoritative printed
                     text. Such a manuscript had to be more carefully prepared than a press copy, because
                     it would neither be vetted by publisherʼs readers and compositors nor corrected in
                     proof” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#REIMANMODERNMANUSCRIPTS"><span class="persName">Reiman</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Study of Modern Manuscripts</span></span></a>, 92, 93, 94–95).</p>

                     <p>Compared to the conditional status of the literary manuscript in the modern age of
                        print, the “polish” of the manuscript prepared for confidential circulation confers

Authority is assured by limiting the intended audience to the private and confidential,

                        barbs and share the humor of them” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#REIMANMODERNMANUSCRIPTS"><span class="persName">Reiman</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Study of Modern Manuscripts</span></a>, 94). <span class="persName">Reiman</span> emphasizes the circumscribed confidentiality of audience as bolstering the authority
                        required for satire, whereas from the standpoint of the child author, the model of
                        nineteenth‐century print culture empowered the writer by taking into oneself the structures
                        of editorial authority and bookmaking. The materiality—the polish—of nineteenth‐century
                        juvenilia is as significant as the rhetorical and textual relation between author
                        and a private or confidential audience, because, as <span class="persName">Christine Alexander</span> remarks about the embodiment by child authors of the specifically nineteenth‐century
                        phenomenon of magazine culture, the serious play of appropriating this material world
                        of print prevented the writer from “simply being colonized by the teaching adult”,
                        and instead enabled the writer and maker to “coloniz[e] the adult world itself by
                        remaking it in the image of the self; and it is by this process that the child discovers
                        the self” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERPLAYANDAPPRENTICESHIP"><span class="persName">Alexander</span>, <span class="titlem">“Play and Apprenticeship: The Culture of Family Magazines”</span></a>, 31).</p>
                     <p>To understand how the nineteenth‐century child writer embodies the self in the materiality
                        of the polished confidential manuscript, the markup routine should so far as possible
                        capture physical as well as textual features. As remarked in <a class="link_ref" href="#MATERIALITY" title="Expressing the Materiality of the Manuscripts">Expressing the Materiality of the Manuscripts</a>, this routine necessarily involves the encoder in interpreting and not just mechanically
                        capturing such marks, if only to be able to classify marks of which the purpose may
                        not as yet be entirely understood (see <a class="link_ref" href="#TRANSCRIPTION" title="Transcription and Markup Protocol">Transcription and Encoding Procedures</a>). Moreover, the scope of the archive must comprise the entirety of known manuscripts,
                        even when multiple copies of a text present few substantive variants, since the various
                        draft and fair copies may represent varying occasions of audience (see <a class="link_ref" href="#SCOPE" title="The Scope of ERM">The Scope of <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span></a>).</p>

                     <p>The boundaries of the private or confidential status of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs manuscripts appear to have been negotiable owing to his parentsʼ involvement, unlike
                        the <span class="orgName">Brontës</span>ʼ miniature play world of print imitation, which was illegible to <span class="persName">Patrick Brontë</span>. We know that <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span> carried some of his sonʼs manuscripts with him on his travels, but we know little
                        about which manuscripts he chose or to whom (if anybody) he exhibited them. In the
                        family letters, we get a glimpse of the parents negotiating the boundaries of audience
                        between them, while <span class="persName">John James</span> was on the fly in his travels, as <span class="persName">Margaret</span> extended the confidential audience to include their friends, <a class="link_ref" href="monro_robert_mrs_note.php"><span class="persName">Richard</span> and <span class="persName">Mary</span> Gray</a>, who had recently resettled in <span class="placeName">Glasgow</span>: “I should like Mr. &amp; Mrs. Gray to see Johns letters”, <span class="persName">Margaret</span> wrote to her husband, suggesting that he “make up a small parcel and send also [the
                        poems] <span class="titlem">the fairies</span>—<span class="titlem">the lines on <span class="persName">Jessy</span></span> these on <span class="titlem"><span class="persName">Lord Nelson</span></span>[.] I do not know exactly what you have but any you might wish to send I could let
                        you have—<span class="titlem">Weep for the Dead</span>—<span class="titlem">O to My Heart</span> I should like them to see” (<a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1831-03-05_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">5 March 1831</span></span></a>, in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span>, ed. <span class="persName">Burd</span></a>, 1:232). The episode complicates <span class="persName">Reiman</span>ʼs example drawn from <span class="persName">Austen</span>, which suggests that the child author has solitary control over who is included in
                        a confidential audience, the boundaries of which are implicit in the text. Here, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents not only can decide who is privy to their sonʼs manuscripts but they also
                        evidently exercise their own ideas about which poems are appropriate to be shared.
                        If the parcel contained fair copies in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs hand, then the authority implicit in the polish of the manuscripts also became
                        transferable. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether <span class="persName">Margaret</span> intended “Johns letters” to be shared as holograph originals, whether her term <span style="font-style:italic">letters</span> refers to epistles and/or presentation copies of poems, or whether she proposed that
                        she and <span class="persName">John James</span> themselves make fair copies for the Grays. (<span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs list of poems probably refers, respectively, to <a class="link_ref" href="the_fairies_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The Fairies”</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="on_the_death_of_my_cousin_jessy.php"><span class="titlem">“On the Death of My Cousin Jessy”</span></a>, either <a class="link_ref" href="trafalgar_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Trafalgar”</span></a> and/or <a class="link_ref" href="a_dirge_for_nelson_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“A Dirge for Nelson”</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="weep_for_the_dead_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Weep for the Dead”</span></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="to_my_heart_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“To My Heart”</span></a>, all poems of <span class="date">1830–31</span>.)</p>
                     <p>What does this classification indicate for the “different procedures” that, according
                        to <span class="persName">Reiman,</span> should be observed in editing and analyzing private or confidential manuscripts as
                        compared with public? First, the class of manuscripts that derive authority from both
                        their polished presentation and their confidential status suggests that readers perceived
                        authority in the material artifact itself, which bore direct witness to the authority
                        of the writer—or of something about the writer. “I let <span class="persName">John</span>s letters come just as he writes them”, <span class="persName">Margaret</span> explained to <span class="persName">John James</span> when enclosing their sonʼs letters inside her own, “that you may not be misled in
                        your judgment as to his hopes and feelings” (<a class="link_ref" href="mr_to_jjr_1829-03-04_al_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">letter of <span class="date">4 March 1829</span></span></a>, in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span>, ed. <span class="persName">Burd</span></a>, 1:185]). <span class="persName">Margaret</span> assumes a Romantic idea about writing as an open window to the writerʼs expression,
                        which if copied in her own hand would not only lose authority, but even potentially
                        mislead the reader. There do survive manuscript copies of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs works in his parentsʼ and othersʼ hands, but these are far less common than <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own fair copies; and it seems unlikely that what <span class="persName">Margaret</span> wanted the Grays to “see”—not just read—would have been a fair copy in her own hand,
                        which derived authority from her adult sophistication of punctuation, spelling, orthography,
                        and the like. Rather, “judgment as to [the child writerʼs] hopes and feelings” derived
                        from an intimate experience and knowledge that were available only through the authoritative
                        original artifact; and by virtue of the artifactʼs materiality, this experience could
                        be extended to a trusted confidential circle.</p>
                     <p>Evidence suggests that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> shared this sense of an intended confidential audience that, in <span class="persName">Reiman</span>ʼs defintion, was most likely “personally known to or interested in the author”. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs understanding of these conditions is indicated by his inclusion of a letter to
                        the Graysʼ relation, <a class="link_ref" href="monro_robert_mrs_note.php"><span class="persName">Mrs. Robert Monro</span></a>, as part of <a class="link_ref" href="msii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS II</span></a>, a manuscript that he entitled “vol 1” of his “Works”. By including a letter to <span class="persName">Mrs. Monro</span> as part of the handsewn pamphlet, which consists otherwise entirely of poems, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears implicitly to invite <span class="persName">Mrs. Monro</span> to form part his confidential audience beyond the immediate family circle. The designation
                        “Works”, moreover, attests to the significance of this production, both as a physical
                        thing, a “volume”, and as an abstract promise of more to come.</p>
                     <p>It follows that, as an editorial procedure appropriate to a manuscriptʼs classification
                        as a polished confidential production, an edition of <span class="date">nineteenth‐century</span> juvenilia should include manuscript images, as does <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>; diplomatic, and not eclectic or otherwise “corrected” transcriptions of texts; and
                        a thorough physical description of the manuscript. In <span style="font-style:italic">fin de siècle</span> editions of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs early poems and prose, some interest in the physical manuscripts was attested by
                        facsimiles of selected manuscript pages, although the basis of selection was rarely
                        made evident, and the sparseness of such examples, which was doubtless legislated
                        in part by cost, was probably limited also by a perception that such images satisfied
                        curiosity rather than providing essential scholarly information. Manuscript facsimiles
                        in these editions, like reproductions of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs drawings, were printed on heavier paper stock and bound only into the large‐paper,
                        quarto collectorʼs edition of the <a class="link_ref" href="poems_1891_note.php"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (1891)</span></a>, and not in the inexpensive octavo editions. In the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a>, manuscript facsimiles seem to gain scholarly purpose, but in fact the manuscripts
                        selected for reproduction tend to be as random and lacking in context as those in
                        <span class="persName">George Allen</span>ʼs collectorʼs editions of the youthful writing, which he published in the <span class="date">1890s</span>. The early editors did supply descriptive bibliographies of the manuscripts, but
                        the descriptions were limited in detail; and as argued above in <a class="link_ref" href="#DEFINING" title="Defining Works and Manuscripts">Defining <span style="font-style:italic">Works</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Manuscripts</span></a>, lost even more coherence and consistency in the transition from <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1891</span>)</span> to the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span>.</p>
                     <p>While there was a perception among late‐Victorian editors, then, that the confidentiality
                        of early writing needed to be represented through its artifactual status—allowing
                        a childʼs manuscripts to “come just as he writes them”, as <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span> suggested, in order that the reader may form a “judgment as to [the childʼs] hopes
                        and feelings”—editors apparently believed that they met such a need by supplying a
                        few facsimiles in “large‐paper” editions as curiosities for specialized collectors.
                        Once the readership was widened beyond collectors to include the anonymous, public
                        consumption of a “common” edition, such curiosities were dropped, while the editorʼs
                        duty remained only (in both common and collectorsʼ editions) to intervene heavily
                        in the texts in order to “improve” them according to a public standard of uniform
                        punctuation and formal decorum. As <span class="persName">Christine Alexander</span> comments, in late‐Victorian editions of nineteenth‐century authorsʼ juvenilia, heavy‐handed
                        “improvement” of texts was typical of editorial approaches to what were condescendingly
                        termed an authorʼs juvenile “effusions”. <span class="persName">Alexander</span> contends that these “poorly transcribed, bowdlerized and ‘improved’” texts wholely
                        “reinforce the attitude of inferiority towards early works and show the kind of disrespect
                        for childhood that was common well into the twentieth century”—perhaps a somewhat
                        overstated claim, given that this attitude was tempered by editorsʼ acknowledgement
                        of the special artifactual status that juvenile manuscripts held for their original,
                        confidential readership (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALEXANDERDEFINING"><span class="persName">Alexander</span>, <span class="titlem">“Defining and Representing Literary Juvenilia”</span></a>, 84, and see 81–84). Nonetheless this materiality retained its value primarily among
                        collectors and did not affect the the editorʼs mission to “improve” the texts for
                        a modern, anonymous audience.</p>

                  <p>The archive contains, at the most fundamental level, two sets of edited primary materials:
                     <span style="font-style:italic">works</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">manuscripts</span>.</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li class="item">A <span style="font-style:italic">work</span> in this edition consists of a discrete text by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> (e.g., a poem, an essay, a sermon, a mathematical proof), including all available
                        witnesses of that text (each of these edited and annotated), and accompanied by the
                        workʼs explanatory apparatus and available facsimiles.</li>
                     <li class="item">A <span style="font-style:italic">manuscript</span> is a physical document manifesting <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs texts. A given work may be confined, so far as presently known, to a single text
                        witness found in a single manuscript; or a work may be made up of multiple text witnesses
                        found in more than one manuscript.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>In the archive, a work is represented by diplomatic transcriptions of all available
                     witnesses, from its manuscript through its nineteenth‐century published instantiations,
                     the range typically terminating in a version published in the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span> of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs <span style="font-style:italic">Works</span></a>, which launched in <span class="date">1903</span> with editions of the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Early Prose</span></span> and <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span></span>. All transcriptions are annotated with glosses, both textual and contextual, and
                     each work is introduced by a descriptive and critical apparatus.</p>
                  <p>Traditionally in Ruskin studies, major manuscripts, which were originally bound notebooks
                     or bound later by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs editors, were numbered by the editors; and the manuscriptsʼ nomenclature and physical
                     arrangement were retained when distributed among various repositories. In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, these major manuscripts are each represented by a critical apparatus; and facsimiles
                     of the major manuscripts are presented both in whole and in part, divided into pages
                     associated with each of the discreet <span style="font-style:italic">works</span> that make up the contents of the manuscripts.</p>
                  <p>Besides the commentary attached to specific works and manuscripts (the apparatuses
                     and glosses), other commentary, which is hyperlinked throughout the archive, includes
                     notes summarizing biographical, bibliographical, geographical, and contextual information.
                     For illustrating the Ruskin family journeys, maps with timelines are under development
                     (see <a class="link_ref" href="plan_of_archive_note.php">Plan of the Archive</a>).</p>
                  <p>As translated into Web pages, these two sets of materials form, respectively, a given
                     workʼs Work Pages, and a given manuscriptʼs Manuscript Pages. This design was initially
                     based on the organization of <a class="link_ref" href="poems_1891_note.php"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1891</span>)</span></a> by its editor, <a class="link_ref" href="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span></a>; and on the similar organization of the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php"><span class="titlem">Library Edition</span></a> by its editors <a class="link_ref" href="cook_e_t_note.php"><span class="persName">E. T. Cook</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="wedderburn_note.php"><span class="persName">Alexander Wedderburn</span></a>. Similarly, these earlier patterns of organization were reflected in the approaches
                     to bibliographical description by <a class="link_ref" href="viljoen_h_g_note.php"><span class="persName">Helen Viljoen</span></a>. The present editor, <span class="persName">David Hanson</span>, absorbed <span class="persName">Viljoen</span>ʼs notes on the early manuscripts through the generosity of <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span>, when <span class="persName">Viljoen</span>ʼs papers remained in his keeping, and later when <span class="persName">Burd</span> deposited her papers at the <span class="orgName">Pierpont Morgan Library</span>.</p>
                  <p>While building on these past approaches, <span class="persName">Hanson</span> came to recognize how the organization of the archive into separate <span style="font-style:italic">works</span> with their respective bodies of commentary—poems, essays, sermons, and so on—lent
                     necessary bibliographic commentary but concealed a dynamic tension that interested
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>—a tension between a given textual work and the material manuscript containing it,
                     the container often presenting possibilities for expansion that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> exploited and explored. From the earliest juvenilia, he was evidently fascinated
                     by the dynamic potential of a work to contain or be contained by something else. If
                     <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> carried on in the path of earlier editions, routinely separating “lexical codes”
                     from “bibliographical codes” according to historical precedent, we would achieve apparent
                     clarity on the archive but at the expense of a characteristically Ruskinian feature.</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.2.7. </span><span class="head">〈teiCorpus〉 Markup and the Tension between Works and Corpora</span></h3>
                  <p>Editing the early <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> manuscripts calls for representing both the integrity of a unitary work and what
                     <span class="persName">Neil Fraistat</span> terms its <span style="font-style:italic">contexture</span>—the workʼs potential to contribute to some grander stage of organization (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#FRAISTATPOEMANDTHEBOOK"><span class="persName">Fraistat</span>, <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">The Poem and the Book</span></span></a>, 4). <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> used his manuscripts to build contexture among the works they contain, sometimes
                     exploring loose associations among rapidly drafted, successive fragments in the rough‐draft
                     notebooks, <a class="link_ref" href="msvi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS VI</span></a> and <a class="link_ref" href="msviii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS VIII</span></a>, and sometimes treating manuscripts as “volumes” or miscellanies in an expanding
                     corpus—the individual volumes themselves often made up partly of anthologies, as found
                     in several of the <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php">Red Books</a> and in <a class="link_ref" href="msv_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS V</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="msvii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS VII</span></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="msix_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IX</span></a> (see <a class="link_ref" href="overview_of_mss_note.php">Overview of Manuscripts</a>). To represent both the contexture of the unitary work and the integrity of the unitary
                     work in itself, <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> uses the <span class="orgName">TEI</span> element, 〈teiCorpus〉, combined with standoff markup using <span class="titlem">XInclude</span>. Since 〈teiCorpus〉 can both contain and be contained by other 〈teiCorpus〉 documents,
                     we have found that the element serves as the most available means to represent <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs double centeredness in both work and manuscript, text and contexture.</p>
                  <p>A simplified schematization of the 〈teiCorpus〉 markup representing <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a> appears as follows.</p>

                  <p>Typically, the highest‐level entity described as a <span style="font-style:italic">corpus</span> in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> is the bound <span style="font-style:italic">manuscript</span>, which <a class="link_ref" href="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span></a> likewise recognized as the chief entity of the archive, and which he numbered according
                     to a rough chronological sequence by roman numeral in his <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note”</span>. In the <span class="titlem">Library Edition</span>, <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span> expanded on <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note”</span> by listing all of the titles of works contained in each of these bound manuscripts,
                     listing the titles in the sequence in which they occur (which is not necessarily an
                     indication of their order of composition). They did the same for collections that
                     were not originally bound, rather that they had gathered and bound themselves (usually
                     in red buckram), entitled with a roman numeral, and inserted into their expanded version
                     of <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs <span class="titlem">“Preliminary Note”</span>. This attention to the bound manuscript as a container did not fundamentally affect
                     editorial practice in either <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs or <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span>ʼs case: their practices still centered on the discrete text, presented chronologically.
                     In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> likewise, we transcribe and annotate discrete works (using a documentary approach,
                     not the earlier editorsʼ eclectic and aesthetic approaches), but we also seek to describe
                     <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs strategies for contexture. The results are expressed as what the user finds listed
                     on the Index Page as <span style="font-style:italic">manuscripts</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">corpora</span>.</p>
                  <p>Manuscripts that were bound when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> first used them (e.g., the <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php">Red Books</a>, ledgers, and other half‐ or quarter‐calf notebooks) presented a space defined by
                     the parameters of their covers, which he conceptualized filling (at least initially)
                     in some cases as “volumes” in a series, such as the volumes of the “Harry and Lucy”
                     lessons, along with their complementary poetry anthologies (e.g., <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="msii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS II</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="msiiia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IIIA</span></a>); and which he formed in other cases as miscellanies, such as the <a class="link_ref" href="battle_of_waterloo_ms_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Battle of Waterloo, A Play, in Two Acts, with Other Small Poems, Dedicated to His
                           Father”</span></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="msv_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS V</span></a>, entitled “Miscellaneous Poetry”. The term <span style="font-style:italic">corpora</span> is reserved in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> for those collections showing particularly strong contexture, because <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> developed them as a unified project, often (but not necessarily) assigning an encompassing
                     title. Corpora include the separate poetry anthologies found in the <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php">Red Books</a>; the serialized works, each of which may be viewed separately as discrete texts,
                     but which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> explicitly linked together as a common project, such as the “Harry and Lucy” lessons;
                     and most interestingly, works that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> evolved as composite, multi‐genre compilations, such as the <a class="link_ref" href="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>.</p>

                     the contexture of corpora elevated by only a degree of intentionality above that of
                     major manuscripts—the latter exhibiting looser but still definable contexture, such
                     as <a class="link_ref" href="msv_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS V</span></a>, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> compiled incrementally, open‐endedly, and apparently somewhat randomly, one fair‐copy
                     poem after another, yet still definably as “Miscellaneous Poetry”. In terms of <span class="orgName">TEI</span> markup, both corpora and manuscripts are enclosed by the same 〈teiCorpus〉 element.
                     The slippage of one category into the other reflects <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own dynamic process of containment and expansion. He was even apt at times, like
                     <span class="persName">Wordsworth</span>, to think of the entirety of his “works” as a single corpus, as suggested by his
                     annotation on <a class="link_ref" href="msii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS II</span></a>.</p>
                  <p>A more conventional way of representing anthologies in <span class="orgName">TEI</span> markup is to enclose multiple, related texts with the 〈group〉 element. Since this
                     element can nest only within a 〈TEI〉 document, and unlike 〈teiCorpus〉 cannot itself
                     contain a 〈TEI〉 document, the 〈group〉 element is too inflexible to accommodate <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>ʼs design for both single works and corpora or manuscripts. Single works are represented
                     by multiple 〈TEI〉 documents—typically, an apparatus, multiple witnesses and facsimiles,
                     and glosses—while corpora and manuscripts are also represented by multiple 〈TEI〉 documents,
                     including an apparatus plus the sequence of works comprised by the collection (each
                     work again consisting of its multiple 〈TEI〉 documents). An advantage that the 〈group〉
                     element holds over 〈teiCorpus〉 is that the former is designed to accommodate a 〈head〉
                     element, which would more satisfyingly encode a title, such as <span class="titlem">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</span>, as compared with what is shown in the sample markup above. Instead, using 〈teiCorpus〉,
                     either one must attach the anthology title as a 〈head〉 to the germane witness of the
                     first item in the anthology, which is badly formed markup; or, as we have done above,
                     one must insert the title as a separate <span class="orgName">TEI</span> document. Arguably, however, the latter procedure is as well‐formed as it is valid
                     in the frequent cases in which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs titles and title pages refuse to conform to the structures that the 〈group〉 element
                     was designed to describe. The 〈teiCorpus〉 element more flexibly accounts for <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs dynamic play with the relation between container and contained.</p>
                  <p>For example, in the originally blank, pre‐bound notebook that <span class="persName">Collingwood</span> named <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a>, and that the Ruskin family knew as one of the <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php">Red Books</a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> used the inside front endboard to make a title page for a text, <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy . . . Vol I”</span></a>, possibly intending the work, at least initially, to be coextensive with the entirety
                     of the physical notebook (see <a class="link_ref" href="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php#TITLE"><span class="titlem">“Harry and Lucy Concluded”</span>: Title</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php#TITLE">MS I: Title</a>). Whatever his initial plan was, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> completed <span class="titlem">“Volume I”</span> of this prose work without filling the notebook—a terminus that he declared by inscribing
                     “end of Harry and Lucy”, and carrying on by adding an anthology, <a class="link_ref" href="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</span></a>. This, too, reached a terminus, which he declared with a colophon:</p>
                  <div class="floatingText">
                     <div class="floatingText_body">
                        <div class="teidiv3" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2_div.7_floatingText.3_body.1_div.1">
                           <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.2.7.1. </span></h4>
                           <p>The end<br/> <span class="placeName">hernhill</span><br/> <span class="placeName">fountain street</span><br/> <span class="scratchout">end of the poems</span><br/> juvenile library <span class="placeName">fountain street</span></p>
                        </div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
                  <p>This colophon reflects the play of closure by declaring a second ending—the “end of
                     the poems”—specifying the end of the poetry anthology. This declaration was erased
                     by somebody, using a rough pencil scratchout, perhaps in order to shift the emphasis
                     to the end of a larger entity comprising <span class="titlem">volume 1 of “Harry and Lucy”</span> plus the poetry anthology, <span class="titlem">“Poetry”</span>. The colophon had perceptibly altered the usage of “volume” on the original title
                     page of <span class="titlem">MS I</span>, which was clearly meant to apply only to the prose work. Were we instead to use
                     the 〈group〉 element, which calls for a 〈front〉 element to contain frontmatter, we
                     could not represent a title page that is in flux. We may not have described <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs dynamically developing ideas much more vividly using 〈teiCorpus〉, but at least
                     we have not misrepresented his ideas.</p>
                  <p>Our usage of 〈teiCorpus〉 also permits description of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs manuscripts and corpora as collaborative or mediated documents, which were sometimes
                     glossed by his parents. We do not know who scored through “end of the poems” in the
                     colophon of <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a>, but it was certainly <span class="persName">Ruskinʼs mother</span> who inserted a gloss amid the poems making up <a class="link_ref" href="msi_poetry_anthology_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“Poetry” [MS I Poetry Anthology]</span></a>. She wanted to date precisely her sonʼs beginning and completion of the manuscript.
                     The determinacy of <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs gloss, with its definite “this book begun” and “finished”, competes with the ambivalent
                     play of <span class="persName">John</span>ʼs closure (see <a class="link_ref" href="mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">Margaret Ruskinʼs Gloss on the Dating of MS I</span></a>). While not necessarily intended to impose her will on the manuscript, <span class="persName">Margaret</span>ʼs gloss proved as ambiguous as <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own colophon, since both were followed by a new work entered on the inside back
                     endboard—an emblematical drawing, <a class="link_ref" href="heights_of_wisdom_drawing_msi.php">“Heights of Wisdom, Depth of Fools”</a>, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> dated a few months later than <span class="persName">his mother</span>ʼs gloss. Such play, whether including an edge of competitiveness or joy of collaboration,
                     cannot be fully described in terms of an <span class="titlem">XML</span> structure; the dynamics of play can be interpreted and discussed only in the archiveʼs
                     commentary. However, the contributions of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs parents are very often convincingly encoded as glosses, which are not in the same
                     class as the editorʼs explanatory and textual glosses that hang from and refer only
                     to specific texts, but which form stand‐alone <span class="orgName">TEI</span> documents (including their own apparatuses and transcriptions) referring to and forming
                     part of the corpus as a whole.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the 〈teiCorpus〉 markup also easily allows for reordering corpora athwart
                     manuscripts. In the case of <a class="link_ref" href="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">Account of a Tour on the Continent</span></a>, an eclectic editorial approach was adopted both by <span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span> and by <span class="persName">E. T. Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Alexander Wedderburn</span> on the grounds that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> left extensive writing for the work in draft along with an ambitious outline for
                     arranging and completing the work; however, prior to realizing that plan, he abandoned
                     the fair copy, requiring copytext to be drawn from both the fair copy and the draft.
                     <span class="persName">Collingwood</span> justified his approach in <span class="date">1891</span> as follows: “[A]s I find from a list at the end of . . . <a class="link_ref" href="msviii_apparatus.php">[MS] VIII</a>” (i.e., the <a class="link_ref" href="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_toc_msviii.php">Plan for Continuation of the Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>), <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> “intended this volume [i.e., the <a class="link_ref" href="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX fair copy</a>] to contain about 150 pieces of prose and poetry, and at least as many drawings!
                     And in saying [in <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Praeterita</span></span>] that he did not follow his tour beyond the <span class="geogName">Rhine</span>, <span class="persName">Mr. Ruskin</span> refers only to this volume, <a class="link_ref" href="msix_apparatus.php">No. IX</a>”, and not to what he had in fact composed. “I am pretty certain that he was not aware
                     of the amount of material existing in rough copies at the back of his book‐shelves”
                     (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS4D1891"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> [4<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date">1891</span>]</a>, 1:266; <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#JRPOEMS8D1891"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> [8<sup>o</sup>, <span class="date">1891</span>]</a>, 1:267). In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, 〈teiCorpus〉 is used to compile the respective edited corpora that conjecturally
                     reconstruct <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs work: <span class="persName">Collingwood</span>ʼs, which includes only poems; <span class="persName">Cook</span> and <span class="persName">Wedderburn</span>ʼs, which includes both poems and prose sections; and <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs multiple versions of the <span class="titlem">“Account”</span>, whereby he evolved the work from a poetic travelogue in collaboration with his father
                     into a composite work of poetry, prose, and illustration.</p>
                  <p>Other compelling candidates for separately and eclectically edited corpora witnessing
                     a composite work include a compilation of the “volumes” making up the uncompleted
                     “Harry and Lucy” narrative, drawn from <a class="link_ref" href="msi_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS I</span></a>, <a class="link_ref" href="msii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS II</span></a> <a class="link_ref" href="msiii_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS III</span></a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="msiiia_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">MS IIIA</span></a>; and the <a class="link_ref" href="sermons_on_the_pentateuch_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">Sermons on the Pentateuch</span></a>, in which the bonds between the sermon texts are stronger than their ties to the
                     manuscripts in which the texts are found. While arguably the five handsewn booklets
                     containing the fair copies of the sermons can be treated as a single corpus, the various
                     <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php">Red Books</a> containing rough drafts of the sermons present a particularly attenuated claim on
                     the texts as composing a portion of their corpora considered as manuscripts. By the
                     time <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> entered the sermon drafts in the <a class="link_ref" href="red_book_note.php">Red Books</a>, these notebooks had been demoted to providing leftover, unused space for miscellaneous
                     draft, and the sermon texts run reverso and upside‐down to what was once a vital corpus.</p>
                  <p>Yet another candidate for 〈teiCorpus〉 markup to describe multiple and conjectural
                     corpora are those that were compiled neither by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> nor his editors, but by members of his circle who were interested in creating anthologies
                     for some special purpose. For example, as previously mentioned, in <span class="date">1831</span> <span class="persName">Ruskinʼs mother</span> proposed that <span class="persName">John James</span> make a small “parcel” of letters and poems to be shared with their intimate friends,
                     the Grays. Such anthologies reveal assumptions about the intended audience of youthful
                     writing in the nineteenth century (see <a class="link_ref" href="#PRIVATE" title="The Private Confidential and Public in the Early Manuscripts">The Private, Confidential, and Public in the Early Manuscripts</a>).</p>

                  <h3><span class="headingNumber">1.3.1. </span><span class="head">Transcription and Markup Protocol</span></h3>
                  <p>In our transcription policy, we strive to abide by the definition of textual transcription
                     proposed by <span class="persName">David Vander Meulen</span> and <span class="persName">G. Thomas Tanselle</span>: “the transcriberʼs goal is to make an informed decision about what is actually inscribed
                     at each point” in a manuscript, although of course editorial “judgment is necessarily
                     involved in deciding what is in fact present”, “as when an ambiguously formed character
                     resembles two different letters”. Despite these calls on editorial judgment, which
                     must be notated, in a documentary editorial procedure the resulting “text cannot simultaneously
                     be unemended and emended” since “no single text” can be both a transcription and a
                     critical text; these “are mutually exclusive genres” of editing, although the same
                     <span style="font-style:italic">edition</span> might contain both transcriptions and emended, critical texts (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION"><span class="persName">Vander Meulen</span> and <span class="persName">Tanselle</span>, <span class="titlem">“System of Manuscript Transcription”</span></a>, 201, 203).</p>
                  <p>For most works in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, the editor supplies documentary transcriptions of witnesses paired with facsimiles
                     (if available) of those witnesses. The archive also provides, as it were, documentary
                     transcriptions of past critical texts of the works, because we believe that researchers
                     will benefit by being able to study, in close proximity with accurate transcriptions
                     of manuscript witnesses, how <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs first editors saw fit to represent those manuscripts to readers.</p>
                  <p>The editor is responsible for the accuracy of all transcriptions of witnesses in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, having taken most of them himself over several years from the original manuscripts
                     in the <span class="orgName">Beinecke Library</span>, <span class="orgName">Yale University</span>; the <span class="orgName">Berg Collection, New York Public Library</span>; the <span class="orgName">Huntington Library</span>; the <span class="orgName">Pierpont Morgan Library</span>; <span class="orgName">Rare Books and Special Collections, Princeton University Library</span>; the <span class="orgName">Ruskin Museum, Coniston</span>; and <span class="orgName">The Ruskin</span>, <span class="orgName">Lancaster University</span>. Later, the project acquired facsimiles in the form of high‐resolution tiff files
                     from the the <span class="orgName">Beinecke Library</span>, which have helped to confirm and improve on the editorʼs original transcriptions,
                     and which are exhibited in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>. The editor is also responsible for final decisions about the interpretation of doubtful
                     readings of manuscripts and for notating these decisions with textual glosses. In
                     scattered instances, mostly involving manuscripts used to supplement annotation of
                     the works contained in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, the editor initially had time in the physical archives only to describe a manuscript
                     and gather information for a critical apparatus, and not to transcribe its contents
                     completely; in those cases, we have sometimes been able to capture a transcription
                     based on a high‐resolution facsimile. This procedure is noted where it occurs, with
                     the expectation of later revisiting the physical manuscript.</p>
                  <p>For support of archival research as well as imaging of the manuscripts, the editor
                     and the Digital Humanities program at <span class="orgName">Southeastern Louisiana University</span> are indebted to the agencies listed on the <a class="link_ref" href="staff.php">Staff and Support</a> page. Without the travel grants and fellowships awarded by these agencies, the research
                     underpinning <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> would not have been possible. The editor is also grateful to the staffs of these
                     libraries and archives, who shared their expertise and supported our research.</p>
                  <p>In the earliest stage of developing the digital archive beyond the research and writing,
                     <span class="persName">Roger Garside</span>, formerly senior lecturer in the <span class="orgName">Department of Computing, Lancaster University</span>, devised a helpful program for translating the editorʼs word processing files into
                     lightly <span class="orgName">TEI</span>‐encoded <span class="titlem">XML</span>, and for generating transformations in the form of <span class="titlem">HTML</span> pages. This program was subsequently replaced as we elaborated our ideas about describing
                     the early <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> manuscripts with <span class="orgName">TEI</span> markup, and also as we pursued a pedagogy for introducing students to <span class="orgName">TEI</span> encoding and to the craft of designing and building online scholarly resources. <span class="persName">Garside</span>ʼs program, however, was foundational for helping us to envision the architecture
                     of the archive. Meanwhile, to advance the Digital Humanities program at <span class="orgName">Southeastern Louisiana University</span>, we benefited from consultation by <span class="persName">Syd Bauman</span>, <span class="persName">Matthew Christy</span>, <span class="persName">Julia Flanders</span>, <span class="persName">Laura Mandell</span>, <span class="persName">Dot Porter</span>, <span class="persName">Lawrence Woof</span>, and the staff of the <span class="date">2005</span> <span class="orgName">NINES</span> Summer Workshop in Digital Scholarship at the <span class="orgName">University of Viriginia</span>. <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> is indebted to these individuals and their institutions for their generosity and
                     good will, which has persisted long beyond their respective workshops or consultations
                     that got us started.</p>
                  <p>In the ongoing addition of new files to the archive, the following routines are observed
                     by the encoding team. First, using the <span class="orgName">SyncRO Soft Oxygen</span> XML editor, encoders pull the word‐processed files of the Editorʼs original transcript(s)
                     of a work, along with files of his apparatus and other annotation, into appropriate
                     templates built for the varying document types included in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>. In a first pass, encoders mark up the Editorʼs original transcription and commentary
                     according to the <span class="titlem">TEI P5</span> standard; and the encoder checks the editorʼs original transcript against its manuscript
                     facsimile, querying any possible inaccuracies. Team members are instructed to confirm
                     transcription of every deliberate mark on a manuscript, in whatever hand. The Editor
                     then reviews the transcription and encoding against the facsimile, and he revises
                     and extends the commentary.</p>
                  <p>As <span class="persName">Vander Meulen</span> and <span class="persName">Tanselle</span> comment: “Obviously a transcription cannot exactly reproduce the relative precision
                     or carelessness with which handwritten letters are formed, or their relative sizes,
                     or the amount of space between words and lines; but it can aim to record every ink
                     or pencil marking of textual significance on the manuscript—all letters, punctuation,
                     superscripts, canceled matter, lines linking or excising passages, and so on” (<a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION">“System of Manuscript Transcription”</a>, 201). We consider this aim, and nothing less, as defining the standard for first‐pass
                     conversion of the editorʼs original files, and for checking or completing transcription
                     against its facsimile at this first stage, because it is impractical and an invitation
                     to oversight to reserve some portion of transcription for a later stage. One can and
                     should review the accuracy and thoroughness of transcription as often as one likes,
                     but no systematic procedure for dividing a thorough transcription into stages would
                     be practical, since one would have to redefine the procedure constantly in order to
                     address the peculiarities of each manuscript.</p>
                  <p>To maintain consistency of markup in this process, the encoding team references an
                     internal Encoding Guide, compiled by the supervising encoder, which lists every element,
                     attribute, and value so far employed in the archive, and which is continually updated,
                     as additional <span class="titlem">TEI</span> elements and attributes or <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> values are discussed and added by the team. The team also constantly references and
                     updates a project‐based Regularization Crib, which is a <span class="titlem">Microsoft Excel</span> spreadsheet listing every <span class="titlem">XML</span> file name by category—the names, that is, of files in the document‐type categories
                     of apparatuses, manuscripts, witnesses, anthologies, drawings, essays, notes, and
                     glosses. The Regularization Crib also lists all standardized editorial titles for
                     these entities; and it serves as the encodersʼ crib for hex‐codes for special characters,
                     <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>ʼs xml:ids for all proper names, titles, and bibliography entries used in the archive,
                     the names used to identify hands, and dates and date ranges used to mark historical
                     events. The team (mainly, in this case, the editor and supervising encoder) continually
                     updates the Regularization Cri as new works, manuscripts, and commentary are added
                     to the archive.</p>
                  <p>To manage workflow, ,  encoders add their name and responsibility to the header of
                     each <span class="titlem">TEI</span> file they edit. When ready for review, the <span class="titlem">XML</span> file is moved (not copied) from the encoderʼs folder and into a reviewerʼs folder,
                     in order to guard against accidental confusion and overwriting of files. The Editor
                     examines first‐pass encoding for accuracy, consulting both his notes from on‐site
                     archival research and the facsimile. After the Editor has reviewed a file for accuracy
                     of transcription and markup, along with consistency with the <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> Encoding Guide and Regularization Crib, it is uploaded for transformation by <span class="titlem">XSLT</span> and the resulting HTML checked for errors.</p>
                  <p>The team steadily adds new works and manuscripts to the archive, and the Editor constantly
                     researches and develops the commentary in apparatuses, notes, and glosses in order
                     to increase the usefulness of the archive for researchers. At any given time, hyperlinks
                     to notes are embedded in the <span class="titlem">XML</span> files that are presently inactive because the source notes are unfinished. When a
                     source note is completed and added to the archive, any pre‐existing links to it should
                     become active. All files are subject to revision and reloading with an appropriately
                     updated version number.</p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.3.2.1. </span><span class="head">Handwriting and Special Characters</span></h4>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs handwriting, like that of any youth, developed over the course of time in terms
                        of manual skill; and because he was interested in the material presentation of his
                        manuscripts, he adopted a range of copybook scripts from handwriting manuals, and
                        he imitated various print typefaces, which he found in favorite books printed between
                        the <span class="date">1820s and 1830s</span>. These developments are surveyed and contextualized in <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>, while discussion of the hand and other material qualities of specific manuscripts
                        are discussed in the apparatuses for both works and manuscripts.</p>
                     <p>In the 〈handNote〉 of the TEI header for each holograph witness of a work, hands are
                        classified by scribe (i.e., the member of the Ruskin family ressponsible), and assigned
                        an xml:id, which, in the case of <span class="persName">John Ruskin</span>ʼs hands, identifies a date range (usually a calendar year) along with any broad strokes
                        that may be used to classify the holograph among a group of manuscripts sharing a
                        peculiarity of hand. In the case of <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs and <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs hands, no attempt is made to use the xml:id to refine the classification of their
                        hands, which retain a stable script throughout the holographs contained in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>.</p>
                     <p>Within the 〈text〉 of the TEI document for each holograph witness, which may contain
                        more than one hand, 〈handShift〉 is used to select the xml:id from 〈handNote〉 that
                        identifies the hand responsible for a given range of text, until a different hand
                        intervenes, at which point 〈handShift〉 toggles to identify the change with the appropriate
                        xml:id. The 〈handShift〉 element also carries attributes of @script and @medium, which
                        are assigned broad values—for @script, typically “print”, “cursive”, or an easily
                        classifiable cursive such as “copperplate”; and for @medium, typically “pencil” and
                        “ink”. These broad classifications are described in <a class="link_ref" href="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</a>, while the eccentricities of the hand used for any given manuscript are relegated
                        to discussion in the apparatus for the work in question, rather than burdening markup
                        values for @script and @medium with excessive refinements. However, where clusters
                        of manuscripts manifest peculiarities of hand, which may be used to help date works
                        and otherwise flag relationships among projects, these classes of handwriting are
                        captured in the values assigned to @script and @medium and may also be coded along
                        with the date range as part of the xml:id given in 〈handNote〉.</p>
                     <p>Where <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> imitates a special character in the style of a typeface, we highlight these using
                        the 〈hi〉 element, with the @rend value keyed to such special usages as “doubleletter”
                        and “doubleletter‐fill”.</p>

                  <div class="sub-subsection" id="JUSTIFICATION">
                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.3.2.2. </span><span class="head">Justification, Runover, and Word Division</span></h4>
                     <p>As discussed in <a class="link_ref" href="#MATERIALITY" title="Expressing the Materiality of the Manuscripts">Expressing the Materiality of the Manuscripts</a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> invented a mark to justify right and left margins in fair‐copy prose, which saved
                        him from having to adjust space between words in a line of text. To fill the gap to
                        the margin, he inserted a horizontal mark of variable length (and sometimes of variable
                        appearance, shaped like an equal sign or a tilde). Since it would misrepresent the
                        markʼs purpose to encode it according to its appearance in length as a hyphen, en‐dash,
                        or em‐dash, or some other symbol, we use a glyph element, assigning it a @type “justification”
                        as follows:<br/> <br/> <span style="text-align: center">〈g type=“justification”〉-〈/g〉.</span> </p>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> often indicated paragraph breaks as minimally as possible. Whether because he meant
                        to use space on a page efficiently, or because he liked the appearance of a more solid
                        block of text, he often failed to indent a word beginning a new paragraph. The intention
                        of a paragraph break can be signaled, despite the lack of indentation, by a significant
                        gap between the end of a preceding line and the right margin, with no justification
                        mark used to take up the slack. Sometimes, however, he fills such spaces with stars,
                        like asterisks, and the following line still seems meant as a new paragraph. Signals
                        become especially confusing when <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> ends a block of text with a dash, which serves some rhetorical purpose such as an
                        excited pause, and which would be indistinguishable from a justification mark apart
                        from white space following it. In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, therefore, we insert paragraph breaks in a text when both sense and some definite
                        scribal feature—such as significant space at the end of a preceding line, and/or a
                        rare indentation at the start of the next line—seem to call for a new paragraph. If
                        the manuscript evidence is ambiguous, the editorial decision is marked by a textual
                        gloss.</p>
                     <p>We encode where line breaks fall in prose manuscripts, and we render these as breaks
                        in the <span class="titlem">XSLT</span> transformation, so that prose witnesses match their facsimiles. In poetry, if <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> wrote an extension of a line as a runover, the line‐break element 〈lb/〉 is inserted
                        at the start of the runover text within the transcribed line, and the element is assigned
                        a @type “runover”, thus:<br/> <br/> <span style="text-align: center">〈lb type=“runover”/〉〈space quantity=“00” unit=“chars”/〉.</span> </p>
                     <p>Here the 〈space〉 element quantifies the number of characters that the runover is indented
                        from the left text margin. (In <span class="titlem">XSLT</span> transformation, the runover also renders as an interlineation.)</p>
                     <p>In some cases of line runover in poetry, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> also signaled the runover with a mark that, in some places, resembles an opening
                        square bracket and, in others, a vertical bar. Usually, he placed this mark at the
                        start of the indented runover line. One can find such a symbol in early nineteenth‐century
                        periodicals using narrow columns, thus causing multiple runovers in printing of poetry;
                        however, printers appear to have reserved this punctuation to identify a runover that
                        they were obliged to set <span style="font-style:italic">above</span> its line, and therefore needed to punctuate in order to distinguish from other runovers
                        in the same poem set as usual below the line, and without such a mark. Several examples
                        can be found in the <span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">London Literary Gazette, and Journal of Belles Lettres, Arts, Sciences, &amp;c.</span></span>, which uses the opening square bracket to mark a runover set above its line—typically,
                        a line that simultaneously carries a runover appearing below the preceding line of
                        verse, and therefore set without the mark (see, e.g., <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#ALMOTHERSMORNINGKISS"><span class="persName">A.L.</span>, <span class="titlem">“A Motherʼs Morning Kiss to Her Child”)</span></a>. <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> does not necessarily reserve use of the mark for this specialized class of runovers,
                        but may apply it indiscriminately to any runover. As an example, see the opening line
                        of <a class="link_ref" href="the_defiance_of_war_msi.php"><span class="titlem">“The Defiance of War”</span></a>, which is encoded as follows:<br/> <br/> <span style="text-align: center">〈l〉War war thou art beating thy〈lb type=“runover”/〉〈space quantity=“28” unit=“chars”/〉〈g
                           type=“runover”〉[〈/g〉drum〈l/〉.</span> </p>
                     <p><span class="persName">Ruskin</span> sometimes used a mark to indicate word division at the end of a line. Like his justification
                        mark, he varied the word‐division sign in length from a mere dot to an em‐dash, and
                        in appearance from a horizontal line to something resembling an equal sign. All of
                        these marks are interpreted without comment and encoded as a hyphen, since the intention
                        is obvious in both facsimile and transcript. Sometimes he divided a word without using
                        any mark at all, if his justified right margin did allow the space; in these cases,
                        no mark is encoded and the line break is represented without comment—the intention
                        again being obvious in facsimile and transcript.</p>
                     <p>One word division mark does call for special treatment, since it appears confusingly
                        redundant. In some cases, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> uses not only a mark at the right justified margin to denote a break but also at
                        the left justified margin on the line below. Typically, the latter takes a form resembling
                        an equal sign. When this mark appears at the left margin and is clearly functioning
                        to signal word division, we tag it as a glyph element, @type “word_division”:<br/> <br/> <span style="text-align: center">〈g type=“word_division”〉=〈/g〉.</span> <br/> As an example of a runover using this mark, see the opening line of <a class="link_ref" href="ehrenbreitstein_prose_msix.php"><span class="titlem">“Ehrenbreitstein” [prose]</span></a></p>

                     <p>In the earliest juvenilia, those dating from <span class="date">1826–27</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> had trouble writing commas and periods on the baseline, with the result that these
                        marks float as if they were apostrophes or quotation marks. In some cases, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> anchors these with an insertion caret (see <a class="link_ref" href="#DELETIONANDADDITION" title="Deletion and Addition">Deletion and Addition</a>), as in <a class="link_ref" href="on_the_rainbow_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“On the Rainbow”</span></a>. In transcription, these floating marks are interpreted as conventional punctuation
                        on the baseline.</p>
                     <p>In another idiosyncracy of punctuation, occurring throughout the early manuscripts
                        and perhaps related to what <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span> has identified in <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs mature hand as a <span style="font-style:italic">half‐comma</span>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> inscribed what look like periods in the middle of sentences, where syntax calls for
                        commas; and conversely, he wrote what look like commas as terminal punctuation at
                        the end of sentences. This reversal, while not consistent, occurs regularly enough
                        that the marks can be treated as glyphs. Thus, the mark is transcribed as the period
                        or comma that its scribal appearance suggests, but the mark is tagged as a glyph,
                        @type “terminal‐comma” for what appears intended as terminal punctuation, and @type
                        “pause‐period” for what appears meant to indicate a pause, not a terminus.</p>
                     <p>As found likewise in letters written by all three members of the family, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> sometimes omits terminal punctuation and instead allows extra space between the end
                        of one sentence and the start of the next. In these instances, the gap is encoded
                        using the 〈space〉 element. However, if terminal punctuation is lacking, and no extra
                        space is evident, we do not supply extra space where it does not exist, as <span class="persName">Burd</span> does in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a> in order to aid the readerʼs eye.</p>
                     <p>If random flourishes and other marks in a manuscript appear to serve only decorative
                        or doodling purposes, and no purpose of punctuation can be discerned, they are ignored
                        in transcription and markup, apart from a textual note atesting to their presence.</p>

                        highlighted), the reader views deletions and additions simultaneously—that is, the
                        final state of the manuscript witness, as it presently appears—with additions appearing
                        above, below, or overlapping with the (grayed‐out) deletions, as the case may be.</p>
                     <p>In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, addition and deletion is not marked up as a single act, using the substitution element
                        (〈subst〉), except in cases of overwriting, which cannot be otherwise interpreted.
                        In many instances of deletion followed immediately by a word that makes sense of the
                        passage, or with such a word placed above or below the line, no other scenario than
                        an immediate substitution seems probable—particularly if the change is reflected in
                        a subsequent fair copy. But we leave these inferences to the reader, relegating our
                        own interpretations to a textual gloss or the apparatus.</p>
                     <p>In the earliest extant juvenilia, a form of erasure and substitution is to allow a
                        mistaken character to stand (or to be erased imperfectly), but to follow that character
                        with a heavily inscribed character, as if the latter were in boldface, in order to
                        emphasize the substitution. </p>

                     <h4><span class="headingNumber">1.3.2.6. </span><span class="head">Metamarks</span></h4>
                     <p>In <span class="date">1833–34</span>, in <a class="link_ref" href="lille_poem_msia_g1.php"><span class="titlem">“Lille”</span></a>, one of the poems for the <a class="link_ref" href="msia_apparatus.php">MS IA, g.1</a>, version of <a class="link_ref" href="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php">Account of a Tour on the Continent</a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> uses marginal symbols to instruct the transposition of two lines from one place in
                        the draft to another place—a meaning for the symbols that is confirmed by his carrying
                        out the transposition in a later fair copy of the poem. We encode <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs symbol for the point of insertion, an asterisk, with the element 〈metamark〉, with
                        its @function designated in this case as “insertion”; and we encode the lines to be
                        transposed, which <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> brackets in the margin, as a span of text. This is a striking, early instance of
                        <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> using symbols that function in the way defined by <span class="titlem">TEI P5</span> for 〈metamark〉 —to encode a scribal feature in a manuscript that does not form a
                        part of the work, but that functions as a direction for how to read the text.</p>
                     <p>All metamarks require an editorial gloss to confirm or speculate about their meaning.
                        In general, it seems, the earlier a possible metamark, the more ambiguous its intention,
                        and <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> is more likely to use a word rather than a symbol. In <span class="date">1827</span>, in <a class="link_ref" href="the_storm_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“The storm”</span></a>, <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> inscribed a word, <span style="font-style:italic">bad</span>, which might be tagged as a 〈metamark〉, but its @function and @target could not be
                        specified with certainty. That <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> intended the word as metadiscourse seems evident in its isolation, placed on the
                        same line as a runover text without its forming a part of that runover in sense or
                        grammar. We can speculate that he intended this negative judgment as a directive to
                        reject the poem's strophe and replace it with another that follows; however, in this
                        and any such ambiguous instance, we can only encode the word or symbol as a 〈metamark〉
                        without confidently supplying a @function or @target. Rather, we can only discuss
                        a possible function and target in a textual gloss and/or (as in the case of <span class="titlem">“The storm”</span>) propose a meaning that is worked out in the apparatus for the poem. Any such apparent
                        metadiscursive interjection in a work, the function of which is unclear—such as the
                        ejaculations, “Play” and “arretez Oh arretez,” in <a class="link_ref" href="on_skiddaw_and_derwent_water_apparatus.php"><span class="titlem">“On Skiddaw and Derwent Water”</span></a>—is is encoded with 〈metamark〉 and its @function assigned the value “unclear”; speculation
                        about function and target is reserved for a textual gloss and/or apparatus.</p>

                  <p><span style="font-style:italic">Glosses</span> fall into two categories:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li class="item">Encoded as a @type of 〈div〉, a gloss is a kind of work (see <a class="link_ref" href="#DEFINING" title="Defining Works and Manuscripts">Defining <span style="font-style:italic">Works</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Manuscripts</span></a>), which is typically a commentary on another work or a corpus, inscribed directly
                        on the manuscript witness of that work or corpus, and often written by some agent
                        other than the author of the original work or corpus. As works, these sorts of glosses
                        are represented by their own apparatus and witness. An example is <a class="link_ref" href="mr_gloss_dating_msi_apparatus.php"><span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs Gloss on the Dating of <span class="titlem">MS I</span></a></li>
                     <li class="item">Encoded as a @type of 〈note〉, a gloss is editorial commentary. It is this kind of
                        gloss with which the present discussion is concerned, since these glosses supply necessary
                        clarifications of editorial procedure and extensions of markup. They are further subdivided
                        into two kinds: 
                        <ul>
                           <li class="item">explanatory;</li>
                           <li class="item">textual.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The editor's explanatory and textual glosses are localized to annotating transcripts
                     of specific works, as compared with the form of commentary called <span style="font-style:italic">notes</span>, which are free‐standing and hyperlinked throughout the archive. (see <a class="link_ref" href="plan_of_archive_note.php">Plan of the Archive</a>). As the term implies, explanatory glosses contextualize specific passages in a work—too
                     specific to be annotated with a 〈note〉 that would be accessible by hyperlink througout
                     the edition. A textual gloss draws attention a specific textual or bibliographical
                     feature of a witness.</p>
                  <p>Explanatory and textual glosses are accessed through clickable callouts embedded directly
                     in the text. The callouts appear in a different color than that of the surrounding
                     text; and explanatory gloss callouts are sequenced in arabic numerals, while textual
                     gloss callouts are sequenced by lowercase letters.</p>
                  <p>While it is typically recommended in print editions that such annotations be referenced
                     by line number in order to maintain a clear text, without the clutter of note callouts
                     (see, e.g., <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#KLINEPERDUEDOCUMENTARY">Kline and Perdue, <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Documentary Editing</span></a>, 117), two factors render embedded callouts more practical in <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>. First, because the archive preserves the separate integrity of multiple witnesses
                     of a work, a gloss must be capable of hyperlinking to the same or similar string of
                     characters found in more than one witness, without regard to differences between witnesses
                     in line numbering. Second, because the archive preserves the evidence of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own line numbering, which he applied to some witnesses, annotation callouts need
                     to work independently that numbering, which is often confused or erroneous.</p>
