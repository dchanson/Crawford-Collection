                <p>The archive <hi rend="italic">Early Ruskin Manuscripts</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>)
                    contains, at the most fundamental level, two sets of edited primary materials: 
                    <hi rend="italic">works</hi> and <hi rend="italic">manuscripts</hi>.</p>
                    <list type="ordered">
                        <item>A <hi rend="italic">work</hi> in this edition consists of a discrete text 
                            by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> (e.g., a poem, an essay, a 
                            sermon, a mathematical proof), introduced by a critical apparatus, 
                            and represented diplomatically by all available witnesses of that text. Each witness is facsimiled 
                            in manuscript and in nineteenth&#x2010;century published forms, if available, and annotated with commentary. 
                            In scope, works range from only a few lines of verse to a composite&#x2010;genre project extending over many lengthy sections of verse, prose, and graphic illustration. 
                            Excluded from the plan of the edition are transcriptions of certain early letters that have been edited by 
                            <persName corresp="#VAB">Van Akin Burd</persName> in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL"><title type="book" corresp="#RFL"><hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></title></ref>. 
                            Facsimiles of holograph letters, however, are included if available; and works contained within early letters, 
                            such as poems, are given full editorial treatment as discreet works.</item> 
                            
                        <item>A <hi rend="italic">manuscript</hi> is a physical document manifesting 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s texts. Traditionally in Ruskin studies, 
                            major manuscripts, which were originally bound notebooks or bound later by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s editors, 
                            were numbered by the editors; and the manuscripts&#x02BC; nomenclature and physical arrangement were retained 
                            when distributed among various repositories. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, these major manuscripts 
                            are each represented by a critical apparatus; and facsimiles of the major manuscripts are presented both in whole 
                            and in part, divided into pages associated with each of the discreet <hi rend="italic">works</hi> that make up the contents of the manuscripts.</item>
                    </list>
                <p>Organizationally, the archive turns on these basic units, 
                    as represented by a given work&#x02BC;s <ref type="internal" target="#WORKSPAGES">Work Pages</ref> 
                    and by a given manuscript&#x02BC;s <ref type="internal" target="#MANUSCRIPTPAGES">Manuscript Pages</ref>. 
                    The fundamental relation between these two kinds of units is the manuscript as container and the work as contained. 
                    For <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, however, the separate integrity of these units often posed a creative tension. 
                    He treated some manuscript notebooks as anthologies that assembled many separate works, but he also developed single works 
                    into complex, lengthy composites that usurped the borders of their manuscript witness.
                    The archive aspires to represent and preserve this creative tension in its editorial methodology (see 
                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology</ref>).</p>
