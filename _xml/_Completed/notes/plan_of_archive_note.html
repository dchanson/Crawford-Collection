            </header>
            <p>The archive <span style="font-style:italic">Early Ruskin Manuscripts</span> (<span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>) contains, at the most fundamental level, two sets of edited primary materials: <span style="font-style:italic">works</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">manuscripts</span>.</p>
            <ol>
               <li class="item">A <span style="font-style:italic">work</span> in this edition consists of a discrete text by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> (e.g., a poem, an essay, a sermon, a mathematical proof), introduced by a critical
                  apparatus, and represented diplomatically by all available witnesses of that text.
                  Each witness is facsimiled in manuscript and in nineteenth‐century published forms,
                  if available, and annotated with commentary. In scope, works range from only a few
                  lines of verse to a composite‐genre project extending over many lengthy sections of
                  verse, prose, and graphic illustration. Excluded from the plan of the edition are
                  transcriptions of certain early letters that have been edited by <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span> in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span class="titlem"><span style="font-style:italic">Ruskin Family Letters</span></span></a>. Facsimiles of holograph letters, however, are included if available; and works contained
                  within early letters, such as poems, are given full editorial treatment as discreet
                  works.</li>
               <li class="item">A <span style="font-style:italic">manuscript</span> is a physical document manifesting <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs texts. Traditionally in Ruskin studies, major manuscripts, which were originally
                  bound notebooks or bound later by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs editors, were numbered by the editors; and the manuscriptsʼ nomenclature and physical
                  arrangement were retained when distributed among various repositories. In <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span>, these major manuscripts are each represented by a critical apparatus; and facsimiles
                  of the major manuscripts are presented both in whole and in part, divided into pages
                  associated with each of the discreet <span style="font-style:italic">works</span> that make up the contents of the manuscripts.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Organizationally, the archive turns on these basic units, as represented by a given
               workʼs <a class="link_ref" href="#WORKSPAGES" title="Work Pages">Work Pages</a> and by a given manuscriptʼs <a class="link_ref" href="#MANUSCRIPTPAGES" title="Manuscript Pages">Manuscript Pages</a>. The fundamental relation between these two kinds of units is the manuscript as container
               and the work as contained. For <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>, however, the separate integrity of these units often posed a creative tension. He
               treated some manuscript notebooks as anthologies that assembled many separate works,
               but he also developed single works into complex, lengthy composites that usurped the
               borders of their manuscript witness. The archive aspires to represent and preserve
               this creative tension in its editorial methodology (see <a class="link_ref" href="editorial_rationale_note.php">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology</a>).</p>

               <p>When a user selects a work from the Indicies (by title or first line), or from any
                  other location in the archive, the selection defaults to the <a class="link_ref" href="#WORKAPPARATUSPAGE" title="Work Apparatus Page">Work Apparatus Page</a>. From here, the user may choose from the list of witnesses, and read the main body
                  of commentary on the work. This page is headed by the editorial title of the work,
                  a form of the title that is standardized according to rules given in the <a class="link_ref" href="title_citation_note.php">System of Title Citation for Works</a>, in order to insure consistent reference throughout the archive. (The <a class="link_ref" href="#WORKAPPARATUSPAGE" title="Work Apparatus Page">Work Apparatus Page</a> also includes a section, Title, devoted to explaining <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own title or titles for the work, if any, along with the often complex subsequent
                  history of entitling the work.)</p>

                  <p>From the <a class="link_ref" href="#WORKAPPARATUSPAGE" title="Work Apparatus Page">Work Apparatus Page</a>, the reader may select available witnesses and corpora connected with the work, each
                     of which opens a Work Text Page in Showcase, consisting of an edited transcription
                     paired with a corresponding facsimile of the physical witness. Facsimiles of printed
                     witnesses are limited to nineteenth‐century publications prior to <a class="link_ref" href="poems_1891_note.php"><span style="font-style:italic">Poems</span> (<span class="date">1891</span>)</a> and the <a class="link_ref" href="library_edition_note.php">Library Edition</a> (<span class="date">1903–12</span>), which are widely available.</p>

                     <p><span style="font-style:italic">Showcase</span> is the display space for Text Pages. The controls in Showcase include the following

                           than one facsimile. The reader may also select the available facsimiles from the pull‐down
                           menu between the arrows.</li>
                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Windowpane</span>. A facsimile and its transcript for a particular witness are tied together, and by
                           default they appear side by side in Showcase. Using the windowpane control, however,
                           the reader may fill the window with the facsimile alone, or with the transcript alone,
                           and then return to the divided window.</li>
                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Magnification</span>. A pull‐down menu increases or decreases magnification of the facsimile.</li>

                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Hand toggle</span>. A toggle tool (shown as a pen) allows the user to filter multiple hands in a witness.
                           The default view exhibits all hands without discrimination. A pull-dowm menu allows
                           the user to filter only <span class="persName">John Ruskin</span>ʼs hand, or only other hands that may be present, such as <span class="persName">Margaret Ruskin</span>ʼs, or <span class="persName">John James Ruskin</span>ʼs.</li>

                                 to appreciate a particular passage.

                     <p>It is not a mission of <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> to catalogue and facsimile comprehensively the artwork that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> produced within the scope of this edition (i.e., <span class="date">between 1826 and 1842</span>). However, where artwork forms an integral part of the works and manuscripts in its
                        purview, the archive does facsimile and comment on those figures. Additionally, some
                        other artworks by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> as well as other images relevant to a given work are supplied where possible. Artwork
                        that cannot be facsimiled but is significantly related to the archiveʼs contents receives
                        commentary in the form of <a class="link_ref" href="#NOTES" title="Notes">Notes</a> and <a class="link_ref" href="#GLOSSES" title="Glosses.

                        <li class="item" id="FIGDESC"><span style="font-style:italic">Figure descriptions</span>. Facsimiles of artwork are accompanied by a description that lists dimensions and
                           medium along with other essential information, followed by commentary on influences
                           and other contextual discussion, if pertinent.</li>
                        <li class="item" id="LETTERS"><span style="font-style:italic">Letters</span>. Given the design of the archive, letters written by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> and his family should be treated as <a class="link_ref" href="#WORKWITNESSES" title="Witnesses and Commentary">Witnesses</a>, and some letters do have this status in the archive, in cases where epistles either
                           contain a witness of a work (e.g., a verson of a poem included in a letter) or necessarily
                           constitute a work because a letter or portion of a letter is drafted as part of a
                           manuscript. Otherwise, since the letters were ably edited by <span class="persName">Van Akin Burd</span> in <a class="link_ref" href="bibliography.php#RFL"><span style="font-style:italic">The Ruskin Family Letters</span></a>, <span class="persName">Burd</span>ʼs edition is referenced throughout the archive, with <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> supplying only manuscript facsimiles of letters where possible.</li>

                     the work(s) contained within the manuscript. In some cases, however, <span style="font-style:italic">ERM</span> compiles <span style="font-style:italic">corpuses</span>—entire manuscripts or parts of manuscripts that <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> appears to have regarded as coterminous with a composite work or anthology of works
                     (see <a class="link_ref" href="editorial_rationale_note.php">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology</a>).</p>

                     <p>The Manuscript Apparatus Page is the default destination for any hyperlinked occurrence
                        of a manuscript title, whether accessed through the Indices, Works Pages, or various
                        forms of commentary. The page is headed by the manuscriptʼs editorial title, as governed
                        by rules given in the <a class="link_ref" href="title_citation_for_major_mss_note.php">System of Title Citation for Major Manuscripts</a>.</p>
                     <p>The Apparatus consists of seven sections: Title, Location, Provenance, Description,
                        Contents, Discussion.</p>

                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Title</span>. Declares the editorial title and discusses the history of entitling the manuscript,
                           including <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own title, if any, and his editorsʼ titles.</li>
                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Location</span>. Identifies where the manuscript is currently held, along with any helpful cataloging

                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Provenance</span>. Describes the history of ownership and transmission. For several manuscripts, which
                           share a common provenance, this section consists simply of a link to the appropriate
                           section of the master note on <a class="link_ref" href="provenance_note.php">Provenance</a>; for some other manuscripts, this section describes a unique history.</li>
                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Description</span>. Describes physical characteristics, such as size, color, and kind of binding materials.
                           For several manuscripts, the description analyzes what <a class="link_ref" href="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><span class="persName">W. G. Collingwood</span></a>, using a geological metaphor, termed a manuscriptʼs <span style="font-style:italic">stratification</span>. Somewhat like an account of the collation of a printed work, stratification describes
                           <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs (and, sometimes, his and/or othersʼ) pagination of the manuscript, whether applied
                           to an originally blank, bound notebook or to a compilation of originally separate
                           leaves, bound at a later time. In the case of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs own page numbering, descriptions must often take account of misnumbering of pages
                           and of missing pages. Moreover, this analysis undertakes a reconstruction of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs patterns of use of the manuscript.</li>
                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Contents</span>. Lists sequentially the works contained in the manuscript, with titles hyperlinked
                           to their respective Work Apparatus Pages.</li>
                        <li class="item"><span style="font-style:italic">Date</span>. Provides the inclusive dates for creation of the manuscript by <span class="persName">Ruskin</span> and sometimes by others.</li>

                           <span style="font-style:italic">Description</span> by analyzing specific features of <span class="persName">Ruskin</span>ʼs palimpsest‐like uses and reuses of an originally bound manuscript.</li>
