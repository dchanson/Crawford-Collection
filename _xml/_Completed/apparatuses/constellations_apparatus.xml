                <div type="section" xml:id="TITLE">
                    <head type="section">Title</head>
                    <p>In the earlier of two surviving fair copies of the poem (see <ref type="internal" target="#MAJORMS">Manuscripts</ref>), 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="rft70_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> centered 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS</hi>&#x0201D;</title> above the column of lines. 
                        Then, in what appears an afterthought, he added &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D; to the right in the margin, on the baseline of the main title; 
                        and on a second line below &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">NORTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;, he placed, awkwardly, in the margin to the right of the opening lines of the poem, 
                        &#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">SOME OF THE ZODIAC / AND SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;.</p>
                    
                    <p>While the addition of the trailing lines to the first fair&#x2010;copy subtitle might be explained as pacing <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of the poem&#x2014;that is, 
                        his elaboration of the subtitle as he added constellations from across the hemispheres&#x2014;this 
                        possibility conflicts with the existence of a prior draft. The belated additions could suggest, however, that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> came to understand the hemispheric positions of the constellations only after he first drafted the poem. 
                        As discussed in <ref type="internal" target="#STAGE">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</ref>, this inference is probably too extreme&#x2014;contradicted, for example, 
                        by his clustering, more or less, of constellation groups within the poem, such as the northern circumpolar constellations and the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">Zodiac</name> constellations. Nonetheless, 
                        the evolving title does testify broadly to <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> as a marker of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s developing understanding and his desire to represent that development textually and materially. 
                        The revision to the title may also have posed one motive for giving up on this fair&#x2010;copy manuscript, 
                        <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, and using the same sheet to revise some of its lines (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>In the second surviving fair copy, in <ref type="apparatus" subtype="manuscript" target="msiii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title></ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> incorporated his revisions to the first fair copy, including 
                        allowing space to center the subtitle properly below the main title and above the first line, breaking the three lines as 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;<hi rend="caps">THE CONSTELLATIONS / NORTHERN, SOME OF THE ZODIAC AND / SOME OF THE SOUTHERN</hi>&#x0201D;</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>The fragment of draft of the poem, bound in <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>, 
                        lacks a title. Since the (unnumbered) lines in this manuscript start with line 27 as fair&#x2010;copied, 
                        presumably a sheet containing draft of preceding lines has been lost, which may have included a title. The first state of the title, if any, is therefore unknown, 
                        and we can only speculate about its relation to the apparent expansion of the subtitle in the first fair copy.

                            is a 12.5 &#x00D7; 20 cm vertically folded sheet, written on all four sides in pencil, cursive hand, with some substitutions written in ink, cursive hand.

                            This identification is mistaken: the folded sheet of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x0201C;Constellations&#x0201D;</title> draft has been collected together with a fragment of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;Monastery&#x201D;</title> draft, 
                            which resembles the former in its paper and pencil cursive hand, and the collection misidentified as consisting solely of manuscript of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>. 
                            The two projects were closely aligned, however; see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>.</p>

                        <head type="subsection"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></head>
                        <p>A facsimile of a manuscript&#x2014;the whereabouts of the original being unknown&#x2014;this item consists of two photographs, which document a vertically folded sheet 
                            containing a fair copy of the poem in pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink print lettering in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, along with revisions of the text in his cursive hand, both ink and pencil. 
                            The first&#x2010;stage fair copy was annotated in pencil by <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>.
                            Possibly, the photographs were taken in the course of preparing the 
                            <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.php"><title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title></ref>; if so, 
                            the facsimile was not cited or reproduced in the edition. The photographs are held by <orgName corresp="#RUSKINLIBRARYLANCASTER">The Ruskin</orgName> at <orgName corresp="#LANCASTERU">Lancaster University</orgName>, 
                            catalogued as <ref type="apparatus" target="rft70_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title></ref>.</p>
                        
                        <p>The folded sheet was photographed spread open and laid flat, with one photograph showing pages 4 and 1 (from left to right), 
                            and the other photograph showing the reverse side, pages 2 and 3 (from left to right). The manuscript reveals at least two major stages of composition, 
                            a first stage of fair copying, and a second stage of heavy revision. The fair copy occupies pages 1&#x2013;2 (i.e., both sides of the first leaf), 
                            while the remaining pages 3&#x2013;4 (the second leaf) would originally have been left blank, prior to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s revisions. 
                            Subsequently, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used this blank space, as well as the margins of pages 1&#x2013;2, for revisions. 
                            Thus, the facsimiles preserve a rare instance of a manuscript containing a fair copy of an early work by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> that he subsequently revised using the same sheet.</p>
                        
                        <!--<p> Then, at some point after making this fair copy, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> revised various lines of the poem, using a cursive hand that is 
                            larger, sprawling, and freer than the original fair&#x2010;copy lettering. It appears that he made his initial revisions in a pencil cursive hand and then, in some lines of revision, overwrote the penciled cursive words
                            using pen and ink, likewise in a cursive hand. At least one of the cursive pencil marginal changes (line 54) appears to be in the hand of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, 
                            but this instance corrects a mistranscription from the pencil draft; it does not impose a change on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s original text, as do the marginal revisions in his own hand. 
                            Whether <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> made these revisions before the original fair copy served some purpose such as a presentation, 
                            or revised it after he had made some formal use of the manuscript, cannot be determined.</p>
                        
                    <p>On the recto of the first leaf shown in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> (p. 1 of the original fair&#x2014;copy text), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote his revisions in the margin of the fair copy; 
                        and on the verso of that leaf (p. 2), he entered his corrections in the margin of the fair copy but extending across the fold 
                        into the facing page (which would have been blank in the original state of the fair copy). Here, too, he appears to have revised using pencil and then in some cases overwrote the revisions in ink. 
                        On the verso of the latter leaf (p. 4), he drafted a few lines of a conclusion in pencil and then overwrote in pen and ink.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, on the last page of the folded sheet (i.e., p. 4), the revised lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                            are written over top of a lighter script of lines that I am unable to connect definitively with any extant fair&#x2010;copy juvenilia: 
                            &#x201C;. The scrawled draft suggests notes for a sermon, although it might represent attempted revision of

                        Judging by what little the editors wrote about the poem, they based their dating on an association of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> 
                        with a poem they declare to have been contemporaneous, <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        although they leave the nature of this association unexplained 
                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE"><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="JRWORKSLE"><hi rend="italic">Works</hi></title></ref>, 2:260 n. 1). 
                        Their method was sound but their conclusion inexact.</p>
                    
                    <p>The physical basis for associating the two poems is the similarity of the fragments of rough draft in a pencil, cursive hand&#x2014;so similar that the two drafts 
                        were apparently mistaken as belonging to the same work (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>: Collation of the Original Manuscript</ref> and 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#COLLATION"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>: Contents, <hi rend="italic">b</hi></ref>). 
                        For the place of this draft in the chronological sequence of drafting, revising, and fair&#x2010;copying <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title>, see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref>. 
                        Here it suffices to explain that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand in these draft manuscripts, which is a sprawling cursive in pencil with occasional substitutions in pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink cursive, 
                        cannot be earlier than his first use of pen and ink in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date>; and that the compositional history of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> 
                        places its <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft fragment, which contains lines of book 2 of the poem, no earlier than <date when="1827-08">August 1827</date> and possibly starting as late as <date when="1827-11">November 1827</date>, 
                        following the family&#x02BC;s return to <placeName type="building" corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName> from the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><date when="1827">Tour of 1827</date></ref> to <placeName corresp="#SCOTLAND">Scotland</placeName> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-COMPARISON">Relation to Draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>; <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php#DATE"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>: Date</ref>; and

                    <p>As another physical feature besides the similarity of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> rough drafts linking <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> chronologically 
                        with the composition of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, the first fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> 
                        (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>) shares orthographic eccentricities of punctuation with the fair copy of books 1&#x2013;2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> 
                        (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>). For the first twenty lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title>, each line ends with punctuation, occasionally a colon or full&#x2010;stop period, 
                        but most frequently a prominent comma formed to look like book print, with a dot and a curl. After twenty lines of this observant punctuation, the marks abruptly stop. 
                        This pattern is identical to the punctuation in the fair copy of book 1 and the first eighty lines of book 2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, 
                        in which almost every line of verse ends with a punctuation mark until the punctuation gives out altogether. The pattern suggests that 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have added the punctuation to these poems all at once, layering the marks over top of the already fair&#x2010;copied text, only to grow tired of the exercise and quit. 
                        Thereafter, in the fair copies of both poems, only an occasional punctuation mark internal to a verse line appears&#x2014;a comma or an apostrophe, which is regularly spaced along with the surrounding characters, 
                        indicating that the mark was inserted in the course of fair&#x2010;copying. Moreover, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s penmanship for the punctuation is similar in the two poems&#x02BC; fair copies, 
                        with the marks at the ends of lines of verse tending to float above the baseline (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-COMPARISON">Relation to Fair Copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>These practices contrast markedly with the very sparse punctuation in the fragmentary rough drafts of both <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> 
                        and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> and with the fair&#x2010;copied poems comprising the anthology, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="poetry_discriptive_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title></ref>. 
                        The poems in the latter collection exhibit, moreover, an awkward learner&#x02BC;s stage of penmanship, including tracing in ink over top of characters formed initially with pencil. 
                        These factors put distance between the <date when="1827">1827</date> <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> and the fair copies of 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title>, 
                        which in the eccentricity of their punctuation resemble the usage in <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title></ref> 
                        (<ref type="apparatus" target="msiv_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIV">MS IV</title></ref>), which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> dated <date when="1828-09-28">28 September 1828</date> on its title page. 
                        While the significance of that date within the compositional history of <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201c;Eudosia&#x201d;</title> is obscure, 
                        the triangulation of that project&#x02BC;s punctuation practices with those of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> and 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> appears to situate the latter two projects decisively in <date when="1828">1828</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>But when in <date when="1828">1828</date>? If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> based the first lines of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> on actual observation of the sky 
                        (or perhaps a demonstration at one of the so&#x2010;called Lenten astronomy lectures [see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</ref>), the alignment of planets and constellations described at the beginning of the poem would have been observable 
                        in <date notBefore="1828-04" notAfter="1828-05">April&#x2013;May 1828</date>, and not at all observable in <date when="1827">1827</date> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">Discussion: &#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations</ref>). This approximate dating would place draft and first fair&#x2010;copying of both 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> and books 1&#x2013;2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201c;The Monastery&#x201d;</title> 
                        in the <date notBefore="1828-01" notAfter="1828-03">first quarter of 1828</date>&#x2014;between the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tours_of_1826-27_note.php"><date when="1827">Tour of 1827</date></ref>, 
                        which had been delayed until late in the year, and the <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="tour_of_1828">Tour of <date when="1828">1828</date></ref>, probably begun following <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <date when="1828-05-10">10 May</date> birthday but interrupted 
                        that same month by news of the death of <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sister, <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="richardson_jessie_note.php"><persName corresp="#JRP">Jessie</persName></ref>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Fair&#x2010;copying, and possibly initial composition, during the first months of <date when="1828">1828</date> accord well with the placement of the second fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title>, 
                        which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> entered in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> as the first poem in the <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_poetry_anthology_2_apparatus.php"><title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIIIPOETRYANTHOLOGY2">MS III Second Poetry Anthology</title></ref>, 
                        immediately following <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol 2&#x201D;</title></ref>. While fair&#x2010;copying of that anthology cannot be dated precisely, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would not have waited long to make a fair copy incorporating the extensive revisions to the first fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201d;</title> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy [<title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>]</ref>); 
                        and by juxtaposing that poem as the first in the anthology with the end of the second volume of <title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL2">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy&#x201D;</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> emphasized astronomical learning as a shared interest in both the poem and the prose tale. 
                        In the tale, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRY">Harry</persName> gives <persName type="fictional" corresp="#LUCY">Lucy</persName> 
                        a drawing of the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> &#x201C;as an introduction to astronomy&#x201D; (p. 7). 
                        Moreover, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained the astronomical theme in the poetry anthology by following <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> with a fair copy of <ref type="apparatus" target="the_sun_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHESUN">&#x201C;The Sun&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        which he composed for <date when="1828-01-01">New Year&#x02BC;s, 1 January 1828</date>. That <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s orthographic and punctuation practices appear to have progressed little by the time he composed and fair&#x2010;copied <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</title> several months later&#x2014;the same kind of catalog poem on a grandiose scale, 
                        fair&#x2010;copied with the same kind or orthographic eccentricities and even weirder punctuation&#x2014;can be attributed to a long period of family mourning for the death of his aunt. 
                        His father would have been preoccupied at home and in <placeName corresp="#PERTH">Perth</placeName>, making arrangements for his sister&#x02BC;s estate and orphaned children.</p>
                    
                    <p>Remaining open to question is whether composition of the initial draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> could have begun as early as a date in 
                        <date when="1827">1827</date>, as <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> supposed. 
                        A factor that might argue for confining composition to the <date notBefore="1828-01-01" notAfter="1828-04-30">first quarter of 1828</date>  
                        is the possibility&#x2014;admittedly questionable&#x2014;that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> based his opening lines on planetariy observations that were visible in the sky over <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> only during those months, 
                        and not in <date when="1827">1827</date>. Those details, which survive in the opening lines of the poem as fair&#x2010;copied, are missing along with the first page(s) of draft from the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> manuscript. 
                        Thus, a genesis of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft commencing, say, in <date notBefore="1827-10" notAfter="1827-12">the fourth quarter of 1827</date> can neither be ruled out nor confirmed.</p>

                        are incorporated into the copytext of the fair copy shown in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>; 
                        and strikethroughs and substitutions in the latter are in turn incorporated into copytext for the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                        This genetic history tracks a similar and roughly contemporaneous record of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s development of the poem, <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>, 
                        as witnessed in manuscripts likewise contained in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> and <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. 
                        Only <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, however, includes a stage of composition in which a fair copy 
                        is sacrificed to further revision, at least insofar as surviving evidence can attest.</p>
                    
                    <p>As a stage of development in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s compositional methods, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> along with 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> represent a significant advance, which sprang from learning to use pen and ink in <date when="1827-04">April 1827</date> 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">The Ruskin Family Handwriting</ref>). For the first time, we see preserved draft containing deletions, substitutions, and insertions, both in pencil and in ink, 
                        most of them in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. At least one of the interventions is in the hand of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>, 
                        but this is limited to correcting a mistranscription from the preceding draft. <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> proofread; she did not herself revise <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s text, unless she did so verbally. Evidence suggests that she did censor, however, 
                        by marking text she deemed inappropriate in some way. Thus, these states of text open a window onto <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s compositional process as an interaction with his audience, 
                        his parents&#x2014;with his mother acting as proofreader and, to a limited extent, as editor. Perhaps these states of draft and fair copy were preserved for this reason, 
                        that they recorded a distinct stage of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s learning to write as an interactive process.</p>
                    
                    <p><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> is also significant for its scope. It is one among several projects of <date when="1828">1828</date> which are marked by their ambition and length, 
                        including the versification of <persName corresp="#WS">Scott</persName>&#x02BC;s novel, <title type="book" corresp="#SCOTTMONASTERY"><hi rend="italic">The Monastery</hi></title>, and the &#x201C;poem on the universe&#x201D;, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JREUDOSIA"><hi rend="italic">Eudosia</hi></title>. Of these three, only <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> reached a conclusion.</p>

                        <p>This pencil&#x02010;on&#x02010;paper manuscript in a cursive hand, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIACONSTELLATIONS"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#CEPHEUSCONSTELLATION">cepheus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#BOOTES">bootes</name> now&#x201d;</title></title> (see <ref type="internal" target="#MAJORMS-MSIA">Manuscripts: <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title></ref>), 
                            begins at line 27 of the poem as fair&#x02010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, 
                            and from that point the text extends for 49 lines on all four sides of a vertically folded sheet. 
                            The surviving text starts at the top of 1r of the manuscript, lacking title or context, evidently in mid&#x2010;career of the poem. 
                            While nothing definitive can be determined about whether this manuscript is missing a witness to the original beginning of its text&#x2014;nor can anything 
                            be determined about what that opening text would have consisted of&#x2014;it is likely that the missing draft closely matched the text as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, 
                            given the consistency of the proofreading marks from start to finish on that later manuscript 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">First Fair Copy [<title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>]</ref>).</p>
                        
                        <p>It is possible that an opening piece of the manuscript, now missing, was originally bound in 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>, but that this piece was lost and its survival or whereabouts untraceable, given the current damaged and unbound state of the collection 
                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="msia_apparatus.php#CONTENTS"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title>: Contents, <hi rend="italic">b</hi></ref>).</p>

                            <head type="sub-subsection">Hand</head>
                        
                        <p>The hand is recognizably <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cursive, identical to the cursive hand in his holograph <ref type="apparatus" target="jr_to_jjr_1827-05_al_apparatus.php"><title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> letter to his father</title></ref>. 
                            The latter document&#x2014;the earliest surviving example of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s use of pen and ink&#x2014;is composed almost entirely in cursive using a pencil, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> exchanging the pencil for pen and ink only for the closing of the letter, which he also wrote in cursive. 
                            In the letter, he continued beyond his signature by appending two poems, still using a pen but switching to print lettering. Similarly here, at the end of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> draft, 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> switches from pencil to pen and ink for a closing, &#x201C;I end&#x201D;, written in cursive. 
                            Perhaps he reserved pen and ink for closings in these early cursive manuscripts because the ink suggested to him a sense of finality.</p>
                            
                            <p>In this draft version of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also uses pen and ink for a few minor revisions, making substitutions in ink by striking through pencil draft with a pen and writing the substituted word above. 
                            This usage, too, may have suggested finality to him, an act of polishing the verse. Alternatively or additionally&#x2014;and one suspects this also to have been the case in the <title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827">1827</date> letter</title>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            felt more at ease manually in dipping a pen to form the strokes of print letters as compared with maintaining the flow of cursive. With respect to penmanship, then, 
                            the constrained use of pen and ink in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIACONSTELLATIONS"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#CEPHEUSCONSTELLATION">cepheus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#BOOTES">bootes</name> now&#x201d;</title></title> 
                            represents an earlier developmental stage, comparable to the <title type="letter" corresp="#jr_to_jjr_1827-05"><date when="1827">1827</date> letter to his father</title>, 
                                whereas the first fair copy, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, shows him using a pen not only for extensive print&#x2010;lettering but also for longer cursive phrases, albeit sometimes over top of the same phrases in pencil, so far as one can tell from the photograph.</p>

                        <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have ended the poem twice in draft. At the bottom of the inside recto page of the folded sheet (2r), 
                            he wrote &#x201C;end&#x201D; in pencil, cursive; and on the same line, to the left, he wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in ink, also cursive&#x2014;the ink <hi rend="italic">end</hi> being presumably the second of the two, 
                            though the order cannot be distinguished from the material evidence. This <hi rend="italic">finis</hi> follows <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAPRICORNUS">Capricornus (the Sea Goat)</name>, 
                            the last&#x2010;listed of the constellations in all three manuscript versions (line 64 in the second fair copy, <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>): 
                            &#x201c;and the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAPRICORNUS">goat</name> that is formed in the arched sky&#x201c;. 
                            In draft as well as fair copy, this line carries lexical markers of closure&#x2014;for one, by beginning the line uniquely with <hi rend="italic">and</hi>, as if to say, 
                            <hi rend="italic">and finally</hi>; and for another, by ending the line with a flourish supplied by the quaintly poetic modifier <hi rend="italic">arched</hi> (for sources of this poetic diction, see the contextual gloss for <hi rend="italic">arched sky</hi> in the witnesses).</p>
                        
                        <p>Another ending is found on the back of the folded sheet (2v), where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> added nine lines beyond the ending at the foot of the preceding page (2r). 
                            Below these nine addtional lines, on a separate line by itself, he again wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in pencil longhand; 
                            and to the right of that <hi rend="italic">finis</hi>, he wrote &#x201C;I end&#x201D; in ink longhand. 
                            (Again, presumably the phrase written in ink was subsequent to the pencil phrase, but the evidence is indeterminate.) 
                            These nine lines form the peroration of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>.</p> 
                           
                            <p>As originally concluded, therefore, if the &#x201C;I end&#x201D; on 2r truly indicates an earlier intention, 
                                <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIACONSTELLATIONS"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201c;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#CEPHEUSCONSTELLATION">cepheus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#BOOTES">bootes</name> now&#x201d;</title></title> 
                            represented a less ambitious work poetically, aiming solely at a catalogue of stars without any summary reflection on its meaning. 
                            In this respect, the first version of the poem resembles lists of constellations that could be found in print sources on astronomy aimed specifically at children, such as

                            by <persName corresp="#MMS">Mary Martha Sherwood</persName> (<date notBefore="1775" notAfter="1851">1775&#x2013;1851</date>), 
                            although even <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s lists include implicit commentary in the form of Bible verses 
                                (see <ref type="note" target="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</ref>). <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s chief original contribution to such elementary lists consists in his epithets describing some of the constellations he names. 
                            The version of the poem ending with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAPRICORNUS">Capricornus</name> is an aesthetic, poetic exercise more than a religious or scientific one.</p>
                            
                            <p>With the addition of the nine&#x2010;line peroration, the poem is complicated by a contest between &#x201C;history&#x201D; and &#x201C;virtue&#x201D;. 
                                The meaning and implications of this contest give <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> trouble, as he revises these concluding lines after having fair&#x2010;copied them 
                                in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY">Composition and Publication: First Fair Copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>)</ref>; and <ref type="internal" target="#MYTHS">Discussion: Knowledge versus Christian Faith</ref>).</p>

                            The two poems&#x02BC; drafts resemble one another in the size and kind of paper used for the physical document, and in the sprawling cursive hand used for the pencil draft. 
                            A difference between the manuscripts is that <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;Monastery&#x201D;</title> draft contains no substitutions, 
                                either in pencil or in pen and ink, as does <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> draft in ink over top of the pencil.

                        <p>As remarked in <ref type="internal" target="#DATE">Date</ref>, physical similarities connect the first fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> with the fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, 
                            just as resemblances between the two poems&#x02BC; drafts point to an associated process of composition 
                            (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-EARLIEST-DRAFT-COMPARISON">Relation to Draft of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title></ref>). 
                            The treatment of text in books 1&#x2013;2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> as fair&#x2010;copied in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> has more in common

                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="monastery_apparatus.php#COMPPUB1"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>: Composition and Publication&#x2014;Stage One of Composition</ref>). 
                            For both <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, books 1&#x2013;2, and the first fair copy of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                            <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> adopted a comparatively miniscule print&#x2010;lettering, resembling a serif typeface.</p>
                        
                            <p>Moreover, in the <title type="anthology" corresp="#POETRYDISCRIPTIVE">&#x201C;poetry discriptive&#x201D;</title> poems from earlier in <date when="1827">1827</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> avoided punctuation almost entirely, 
                                whereas punctuation does characterize the fair copies of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, books 1&#x2013;2. 
                                In both, moreover. the punctuation marks share eccentricities suggesting a learner who has an uncertain grasp of the grammatical and rhetorical function of punctuation but who is excited&#x2014;at least initially&#x2014;by 
                            the physical appearance of the marks on the page. Almost every line of books 1&#x2013;2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> is punctuated, 
                                regardless of grammatical or rhetorical need, and the marks are used exclusively at the ends of lines. This obsessive but misinformed observance abruptly ceases at book 2, line 80, of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, at the top of page 79 of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                            Just so, the end of every line of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;Constellations&#x201D;</title> fair copy is notched with a punctuation mark until line 20, 
                            where the practice abruptly stops.</p>
                            
                            <p>Where used, the punctuation in the opening lines of both fair&#x2010;copied poems often seems arbitrary. While the full&#x2010;stop periods make grammatical sense in most instances, 
                            the commas, colons, and (most prominently in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>) an upside&#x2010;down semicolon seem interchangeable with one another in their rhetorical use and placement. 
                            Both these fair copies give the impression that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> layered over the texts 
                            with bookish punctuation to convey the appearance of print, without understanding the grammatical and rhetorical function of the marks. 
                            Finally, in both fair copies, the punctuation markup stops abruptly at an arbitrary place, 
                            suggesting that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> grew tired of the exercise, ran out of time, or was informed about his erroneous usage.</p>
                            
                            <p>The oddities of punctuation, then, in both manuscripts should be classed with other attempts to give the fair copy an appearance of print. 
                                The first letters of each line are capitalized, and the first word of line 1 is rendered in all capitals. 
                                As another bookish touch, lines are numbered by fives in the left margin.</p>
                        
                            <p>Despite these preoccupations with penmanship and presentation, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> and books 1&#x2013;2 of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title> 
                                are ambitious and interesting projects, a leap beyond the lyric&#x2010;descriptive poems fair&#x2010;copied in pen&#x2010;and&#x2010;ink a half&#x2010;year earlier&#x2014;<ref type="apparatus" target="spring_blank_verse_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRSPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Spring: Blank Verse&#x201D;</title></ref>, <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="JRWALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title></ref>, and the poems comprising

                            This mark does not appear in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHEMONASTERY">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</title>, where all the colons are right&#x2010;side up, but the semicolons are upside&#x2010;down,

                            <p>An especially valuable feature of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> fair copy is the evidence of <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s participation in the compositional process. 
                                At line 54 of the poem, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting can be unmistakably identified. The intervention is a penciled correction of a mistranscription of a word from the draft text, 
                                substituting the word &#x201C;bear&#x201D; for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s erroneously copied &#x201C;appear&#x201D;. The insertion is accompanied by a penciled deletion of &#x201C;appear&#x201D; using a style of strikethrough that differs from all other instances of strikethrough, save one at line 30 
                                (see the textual gloss hanging from line 54, <ref type="gloss_contextual" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#MONOCEROSGLOSS">&#x201C;The horn the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MONOCEROS">unicorn</name> doth appear&#x201D;</ref>). 
                                From this evidence, one may infer that a series of other pencil marks on the manuscript&#x2014;a diagonal or double diagonal line at the end of each line of verse&#x2014;records 
                                <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s proofreading of the fair copy against the draft manuscript. That these diagonal marks were <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s is substantiated by their replacement by <hi rend="italic">&#x00D7;</hi> marks next to certain lines of verse, 
                                which evidently signaled her concerns, prompting revisions by <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>. It is possible that the proofreading marks were made by somebody other than <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName>, for example&#x2014;but
                                his handwriting does not otherwise appear in the manuscript.</p>
                            
                            <p>While we can only infer <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s objections based on the content of the original verse and on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s substitution, 
                                the topics that drew her censorship seem evident enough. An <hi rend="italic">&#x00D7;</hi> by the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusa&#x02BC;s Head</name> suggests that the image was deemed too horrible. 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> substituted in the margin a line about the constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM-HERSCHELII">Herschel&#x02BC;s Telescope</name>, replacing the ancient wonder of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MEDUSA">Medusa</persName>&#x02BC;s stare, 
                                with which the pagan hero <persName type="fictional" corresp="#PERSEUS">Perseus</persName> wreaked violence and retribution, with the modern wonder of the seven&#x2010;foot optical instrument, with which the British scientific hero, <persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">William Herschel</persName> (<date notBefore="1738" notAfter="1822">1738&#x2013;1822</date>), 
                                discovered the planet <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URANUS">Uranus</name>. Even the feline violence of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYNX">&#x201C;furious lynx&#x201D;</name> was tagged to be tamed, replaced by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> with its &#x201C;keen&#x2010;eyed&#x201D; attribute.</p>
                            
                            <p>A different kind of horror apparently was suggested by the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARA">Altar</name>, which would have evoked dangerously pagan practices. This line having prompted double <hi rend="italic">&#x00D7;</hi>s for revision, 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> substituted the Scriptural epithet, &#x201C;gods fire&#x201D;, 
                                implying that the &#x201C;strange fire&#x201d; of paganism would be snuffed out (<title type="scripture" corresp="#LEVITICUS">Lev.</title> 10). One other change was demanded to prevent a jest from disturbing the gravity of the subject; 
                                and some lines were marked with an <hi rend="italic">&#x00D7;</hi> for no obvious reason other than to improve the verse: the trite and redundant epithet &#x201C;pretty&#x201D; was rejected,

                            <p>Each of the lines marked with an <hi rend="italic">&#x00D7;</hi> prompted a revision in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand. In most cases, he drafted the revision in the margin adjacent to the line, 
                                first writing in cursive with a pencil, and then in some cases writing in cursive with pen and ink to revise the revision over top of the pencil.
                                Insofar as the available evidence shows, then, the revisions were invented by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>; no other hand is present in the draft revision, 
                                although of course we cannot know what discussion, if any, surrounded his decisions. We also cannot know for certain at what point in the fair&#x2010;copying 
                                the process of proofreading and marking for revision began. Since the poem is fair&#x2010;copied through to the end of the extant <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft, 
                                it is reasonable to conclude that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> completed the fair&#x2010;copying before it was subjected to scrutiny, although some finishing touches are incomplete: 
                                the marginal line numbering halts after line 60, with fifteen remaining lines left unnumbered; and as already remarked, most punctuation, particularly at the ends of verse lines, 
                                is abandoned after about line 20. Perhaps at this final stage of touch&#x2010;up, <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> (or perhaps <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> as well as <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>) 
                                intervened with a review. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may even have been surprised by the demand for revision. The manuscript is unique among the juvenilia 
                                as a fair copy that was subjected to a critique, resulting in revisions made on the fair copy itself.</p>
                            
                            <p>It may be no coincidence that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s marginal line&#x2010;numbering was arrested at line 60, since at lines 57&#x2013;60 the most extensive single passage 
                                is flagged for revision, with a long diagonal line and <hi rend="italic">&#x00D7;</hi>s marking a quatrain about the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra (the Scales)</name>, ending in a mention of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way</name>. 
                                The passage may have been flagged merely because the original lines, both in draft and fair copy, are somewhat incoherent: 
                                the lines develop a paradox of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Scales</name> being capable of weighing &#x201C;nothing&#x201D; yet containing a &#x201C;thousand more&#x201D;&#x2014;more even than &#x201C;the beautiful <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">milky way</name>&#x201D;&#x2014;but 
                                with the implied object, <hi rend="italic">stars</hi>, being absent from the lines. The omission may or may not have been deliberate, 
                                but instead of revising to clarify the paradoxical conceit, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> substituted a couplet that veers to a different topic altogether&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">the Scales</name> as a symbol of justice, 
                                which was a traditional treatment of this constellation, particularly in Roman astronomy (see the contextual gloss hanging from line 57, 
                                <ref type="gloss_contextual" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#LIBRAGLOSS">&#x201C;The scales that nothing to weigh would bear&#x201D;</ref>).</p> 
                            
                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> began the revision of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name> quatrain in pencil at the bottom of the inner fold of the pamphlet, 
                                sprawling across the fold to the opposite recto (pp. 3&#x2013;4, which would have been blank at that point), and coninuing onto the back of the pamphlet (p. 4). Nine lines of cursive pencil text wrestle with the topic of justice 
                                (see the textual gloss hanging from lines 57&#x2013;60, <ref type="glosses_textual" target="constellations_glosses_textual.php#LIBRATEXTGLOSS">&#x201C;that nothing to weigh would bear / . . . / More than than the beautiful milky way&#x201D;</ref>); 
                                and then, at the bottom and top&#x2010;right of the inner fold (pp. 3&#x2013;4), he overwrote this pencil draft with pen and ink, still in cursive, 
                                recasting the lines on <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name> as the couplet they became in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy. 
                                Next, on remaining space in the middle of the inner recto (p. 3), and over top of pencil draft on the back (p. 4), 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drafted in pen and ink new lines on the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way</name> as they appear in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> fair copy (lines 65&#x2013;69).
                                In these new lines, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> expanded on the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way</name>, previously mentioned only as a comparison with what stars could be weighed in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LIBRA">Libra</name>&#x02BC;s scales. 
                                Now he elaborated on the myth of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MILKYWAY">Milky Way</name> as a roadway to heaven for the heroes of mythology. In connection with this image, his revisions reveal that 
                                <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrestled, not just with squeamish objections to violent or pagan imagery, 
                                but with broader concepts such as the relation between &#x201C;history&#x201d; (revised to &#x201C;knowledge&#x201d;) and &#x201C;virtue&#x201d; 
                                (see <ref type="internal" target="#MYTHS">Discussion&#x2014;Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</ref>).</p>

                        and other astronomical phenomena, was composed in context of popular education in astronomy for adults and children 
                        in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1834"> early nineteenth century</date> in <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>. This movement 
                        is surveyed in <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note.php">Astronomical Education</ref>, and parts of the following discussion are keyed to the context of that broader note.</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s purpose in <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> is more poetic than scientific. 
                        As his most original contribution to the versified catalogue of constellations that constitutes the poem, he assigns descriptive epithets to several of the constellation names. 
                        While the poem is not entirely lacking in the influence of children&#x02BC;s scientific lessons in astronomy, which were typical the period, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> admitted in a note added belatedly in the compositional process&#x2014;the note first appears in the <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-2D-FAIR-COPY">Second Fair Copy</ref>&#x2014;that 
                        his arrangement of constellation names is unsystematic with respect to the stars&#x02BC; actual positions in the sky. 
                        The note is less disingenuous than it seems and may play down a significant achievement in spatial imagination 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#PROJECT">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</ref>); 
                        nonetheless, the poem represents an early and playful stage in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s ongoing astromical education 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#STAGE">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as Marking a Stage of Astronomical Education</ref>).</p>
                   
                    <p><!-- start 04-01-24 -->As a stage of learning, the poem is somewhat elusive in allowing one to gauge the extent of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s knowledge about the constellations and their myths. 
                        He derived some of his epithets, not from mythology, but from fables&#x2014;particularly stories that could apply to constellations representing beasts and birds 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#MYTHS">Knowledge versus Christian Faith: The Problem of Mythology</ref><!--; and 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="boyhood_books_note.php#AESOP">Books Used by Ruskin in His Youth: Physical Descriptions&#x2014;<title type="anthology" corresp="#CROXALLFABLESOFAESOP"><hi rend="italic">Fables of <persName corresp="#AESOP">Aesop</persName></hi></title></ref>-->). 
                        Given his mother&#x02BC;s censorship described in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR"><persName corresp="#MR">Margaret Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s Role in the Fair&#x2010;Copying Process</ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have avoided expressing some of what he knew about myth. Regrettably, to understand his exposure, the identity of a &#x201C;lesson book&#x201D; on astronomy mentioned in 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL3">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy . . . Vol III&#x201D;</title></ref> remains conjectural, 
                        but on the evidence of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> he must have had access to an up&#x2010;to&#x2010;date source 
                        like a recent star atlas, which likely would have relayed legendary as well as scientific information 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note#PRINTSOURCES-ATLASES.php">Astronomical Education: Print Sources of Astronomical Education&#x2014;Star Atlases</ref>;

                        contextual glosses attached to each of the constellation names summarize the information commonly available in popular works on astronomy published in the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>. 
                        The information includes the position in the sky and the periods of the year when each constellation was visible, if at all, in the night sky above <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>; 
                        the legends, if any, associated with each constellation, especially the more commonly known Greek and Roman myths connected with ancient constellations; 
                        and the origin of comparatively more recent constellations and their significance for British amateur astronomers in the <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1834">early nineteenth century</date> 
                        (e.g., at this time, the heavens were mapped with a large number of constellations invented between the <date notBefore="1500" notAfter="1799">sixteenth and eighteenth centuries</date>, which became obsolete in the later <date notBefore="1800" notAfter="1999">nineteenth and twentieth centuries</date>; 
                        also, some constellations were typically treated as pairs, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> for some reason separated and named singly in his poem). 
                        Given the uncertainty about <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sources of information, the glosses survey what <persName corresp="#JR">he</persName> may have known, not what he necessarily did know or was allowed or encouraged to learn.</p>

                        is presumptive, based on evidence of his familiarity with this work in

                        This kind of text was more likely to emphasize memorization rather than dialogic exchange; and primers of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> for young readers 
                        perhaps more emphatically staked the purpose of astronomical study in religious admiration rather than practical and scientific reasoning.

                    <p>As indicated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sources, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> is a bookish poem. 
                        Even in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s books, however, <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s tutors begin study of astronomy by directing their pupils&#x02BC; attention to the evening sky. 
                        To what extent, if any, might <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s composition of his poem have involved actual astronomical observation?</p>
                    
                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> opens his poem by hailing <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>. 
                        In the instructional dialogues, planets&#x2014;the <hi rend="italic">wandering stars</hi>&#x2014;are not an obvious starting point for astronomy lessons in the open air 
                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES">Astronomical Education: Instructional Dialogues on Astronomy</ref>). Fictional tutors 
                        typically begin by asking pupils to find the most commonly recognizable constellation or <hi rend="italic">fixed stars</hi>, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>. As suggested by an earlier poem, 
                        <ref type="apparatus" target="glen_of_glenfarg_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#GLENOFGLENFARG">&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg&#x201D; (&#x201C;Glen of Glenfarg thy beauteous rill&#x201D;)</title></ref>, 
                        <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had long been able to orient himself to that formation in the night sky. 
                        Nonetheless, equally striking objects for young stargazers are <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Evening Star</hi>, 
                        and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>, the red planet. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        may have chosen those planets to begin his poem because they are famously beautiful and striking celestial bodies with familiar mythological associations. In his books, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> was singled out for the planet&#x02BC;s beauty 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#PROJECT">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Project in Spatial and Poetic Conception</ref>). 
                        It is also possible that the particular alignment described in the poem&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARSPLANET">Mars</name> visible on the ecliptic, with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> setting on the horizon&#x2014;indicates an actual and datable observation.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> positions <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> specifically as the Evening Star near the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.
                        According to a digital&#x2010;age star chart, the <title type="website" corresp="#SKYANDTELESCOPE"><hi rend="italic">Sky &#x0026; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</hi></title>, 
                        <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> would have been visible from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> as the Evening Star, 
                        setting in the west along with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> 
                        during <date notBefore="1828-04" notAfter="1828-06">April&#x2013;June 1828</date>. (During that period, 
                        another bright object that was visible low in the evening sky, which an observer might have confused with a planet, 
                        was <name type="astronomical" corresp="#SIRIUS">Sirius or the &#x201C;Dog Star&#x201d;</name>, 
                        in the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANISMAJOR">Canis Major</name>. It is positioned directly below <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.) 
                        During those same months, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name> would have risen from the east, traveling &#x201C;high . . . [in] the sky&#x201D;, as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem says, 
                        a few hours after <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> had set

                    <p>This calculation accords with tables of constellations in the <title type="essay" corresp="#ASPINCALENDARIUM">&#x201C;Calendarium Stellaris&#x201D;</title>, subtitled an &#x201C;Easy Method of Finding the Stars for Every Month of the Year&#x201D;, 
                        in the <date when="1825">1825</date> edition of <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName>&#x02BC;s <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</hi></title>.

                        at half&#x2010;past nine o&#x02BC;clock in the evening&#x201D;, the <title type="essay" corresp="#ASPINCALENDARIUM">Calendarium</title> lists <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> as appearing &#x201C;nearly on the meridian&#x201D; in January and moving toward the 
                        &#x201C;space between &#x201C;W. by S. and S.W. by W.&#x201D; by March. The constellation is omitted from the listings for April, presumably because it would have set by 9:00 <hi rend="smallcaps">P.M.</hi> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</hi></title></ref>, 161, 167, 168&#x2013;69). 
                        The digital star chart shows that <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> set in the late&#x2010;afternoon dusk of <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>, preceded by <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>; 
                        and as the weeks advanced, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> set later in the evening than <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, which had vanished by sunset. 
                        A comparison of findings using the <title type="website" corresp="#SKYANDTELESCOPE"><hi rend="italic">Sky &#x0026; Telescope Interactive Sky Chart</hi></title> with the <title type="essay" corresp="#ASPINCALENDARIUM">Calendarium</title> identifies <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>, therefore, 
                        as the period when the tracks of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARSPLANET">Mars</name> overlapped with a sighting of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>. According to the digital star chart, 
                        this configuration was never visible at dusk or nighttime in <date when="1827">1827</date>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tending to confirm these observations in the first quarter of the year, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> includes the southern constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRATER">Crater</name>, 
                        in the poem, which is visible from the latitude of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> in the evening sky, annually from December through May. 
                        The poem also names southern constellations that cannot be viewed from the latitude of <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> at all, 
                        but <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s choice of these appears related to a sentiment for their legends. The choice of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRATER">Crater</name> seems arbitrary 
                        other than its regular rising and setting in the southern sky, culminating in April (see <ref type="glosses" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#CRATERGLOSS"><name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRATER">Crater</name>, contextual gloss</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>It is possible, then, that actual observations of the evening sky lay behind the composition of 
                        the poem&#x02BC;s introductory lines, a possibility that aligns with the evidence in <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB">Composition and Publication</ref> 
                        supporting the year <date when="1828">1828</date> as a probable period of composition or at least revision of the poem. 
                        (Since the partially surviving manuscript of the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIA">MS IA</title> draft lacks the opening lines, the possibility of an earlier date in <date when="1827">1827</date> for the inception of the poem remains open.)
                        April&#x2013;May was typically the period when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> prepared poems for his father&#x02BC;s birthday in May, 
                        thus suggesting an occasion as well as a terminus a quo for the start of either composition or revision of <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>.</p>
                    
                    <p>Whether or not <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> looked up from his books to the sky for an inspiration to open his poem, 
                        he was also prompted to admiration of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> by <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s fictional character, 
                        <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName>, who, &#x201C;looking up to the sky . . . observed so remarkable a constellation, that he . . . begged to know the name&#x201D;. 
                        On learning it was called <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, he &#x201C;was so delighted with the grandeur and beauty of this glorious constellation, 
                        that he could not help observing it, by intervals, all the evening; and he was surprised to see that it seemed to pass on, 
                        in a right line drawn from east to west; and that all the stars he had become acquainted with moved every night in the same direction&#x201D;. 
                        In the opening four lines of the poem, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> echoes the alliterative modifiers with which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> describes the experience of gazing at the constellations: 
                        &#x201C;&#x2018;I should think there would be a very great pleasure in observing such a number of <hi rend="italic">glorious</hi>, <hi rend="italic">glittering</hi> bodies as are now above us&#x2019;&#x201D;

                    <p>Following <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> goes on to name circumpolar constellations&#x2014;all &#x201C;northern&#x201D; constellations, as announced in the first part of the poem&#x02BC;s subtitle 
                        (lines 7&#x2013;14; see <ref type="internal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>). As possible real sightings, it is striking that he begins with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major (the Great Bear)</name>, 
                        which likewise tops the list for April in the <title type="essay" corresp="#ASPINCALENDARIUM">&#x201C;Calendarium Stellaris&#x201D;</title>, that constellation being positioned &#x201C;in the zenith&#x201D;.
                        Moreover, the &#x201C;lower star in the tail&#x201D; of the bear &#x201C;at about 65 degrees high&#x201D; is &#x201C;one of those called <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN"><hi rend="italic">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</hi></name>&#x201d;&#x2014;the next to be identified by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, 
                        albeit not surprisingly.<!-- is mentioned by the tutors in <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s dialogues. 
                        An observer in <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date> could, however, easily have followed <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s cues by 
                        looking up from <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> setting in the west 
                        to trace the poem&#x02BC;s network of constellations overhead. Locating  in the center of the sky, 
                        the observer would find the &#x201C;pointer&#x201d; stars embedded in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> (which forms part of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name>), using these to trace a path --> 
                        All six of the following constellations named in the poem were also visible in April, according to the <title type="essay" corresp="#ASPINCALENDARIUM">Calendarium</title>: 
                        <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco (the Dragon)</name>, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices (Berenice&#x02BC;s Hair)</name>, 
                        <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CORONABOREALIS">Corona Borealis (the Northern Crown)</name>, 
                        Cygnus (the Swan). <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name>, and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusa&#x02BC;s Head</name> 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</hi></title></ref>, 168&#x2013;69).

                        and that choice was a substitution evidently to placate alarm over <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Medusa&#x02BC;s Head</name> 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="#COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR">Margaret Ruskin&#x02BC;s Role in the Fair&#x2010;Copying Process</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>Hereafter in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, the sequence of constellations appears more erratic, with the repeated &#x201C;next comes&#x201D; 
                        ceasing necessarily to refer to star formations that are adjacent in the dome of the sky. 
                        In the second fair copy, in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                        forestalled objections by adding a note with a caveat: &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201d;. 
                        The note is not attached by an asterisk to a particular line in the poem, seeming to refer to the whole, 
                        so it is unclear whether he would have exempted the first fourteen lines from observable phenomena.

                        While no record of this book or a work like it is recorded in the Ruskin family library, <persName corresp="#MSS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> introduces the topic of the constellations 
                        with a heading identical to <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s main title, 
                        <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title>, 
                        and follows that heading with subdivisions, each with its own heading, that sorts the constellations 
                        into &#x201C;Constellations in the Zodiac or Ecliptic&#x201D;, &#x201C;Constellations to the North of the Ecliptic&#x201D;, 
                        and &#x201C;Constellations to the South of the Ecliptic&#x201D;&#x2014;subdivisions that resemble <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s subtitle to his poem, 
                        &#x201C;Northern, Some of the Zodiac, and Some of the Southern&#x201D;.</p>
                    
                    <p>As a catalogue poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> perhaps reflects <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s pedagogical assumption that a child&#x02BC;s act of naming and identifying heavenly bodies precedes 
                        understanding of the physical laws that govern their motion, and the development of a spatial imagination required to grasp the relation of the earth&#x02BC;s revolutions to the apparent motion of the constellations across the sky. 
                        In each of her hemispheric categories, <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> 
                        merely lists the names of constellations&#x2014;the Latin name followed by its English translation&#x2014;which 
                        matches <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s procedure in his catalogue poem, except for his added embellishment of a poetic epithet to describe some of the constellations. 
                        <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> provides no information about each of the constellations; rather, she annotates the respective lists with a Bible verse 
                        that mentions the stars and praises the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Creator</persName>.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a reflection of a <ref type="internal" target="#STAGE">stage of astronomical education</ref>, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> 
                            obviously represents an elementary exercise in naming and memorization. Unlike <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s lists of names, however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s catalogue is not encased within Scripture quotations that monitor the aim of memorization with expressions of piety. 
                        Rather, the compositional history suggests that moral and Christian (but not specifically Scriptural) admonition was layered onto the poem to contain the paganism presented by its list of names.

                   <p>As an aesthetic project, <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D;</title> derives from an exercise 
                       in spatial perception and translating that perception into a graphic representation. 
                       In <title type="book" corresp="#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><hi rend="italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</hi></title>, 
                       <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName> proposes to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> 
                       to memorize the positions of the stars forming the constellations by &#x201C;&#x2018;mak[ing] a mark upon . . . paper for every star 
                       in <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC; Wain</name>; 
                       and I would place the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and I would entreat you to write the names for me, 
                       and this I would do till I was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens&#x2019;&#x201D;. <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> applauds the project 
                       but points out that paper is flat, whereas the sky, as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> says, 
                       &#x201C;&#x2018;seems to rise from the earth on every side like the dome of a great church&#x2019;&#x201D;. 
                       &#x201C;&#x2018;Then if you were to have some round body&#x2019;&#x201D;, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> suggests, 
                       &#x201C;&#x2018;I should think it would correspond to the different parts of the sky, and you might place your stars with more exactness&#x2019;&#x201D;. 
                       The tutor accordingly supplies <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> with a paper&#x2010;covered ball, 
                       enabling him to devise his own celestial globe based on his own observations of the constellations, remarking both the constellations&#x02BC; relative positions 
                       and their nightly movements in the sky. Starting by drawing his &#x201C;favourite constellation of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>&#x201D;, 
                       <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName> next marks the constellation situated on the opposite side of the Pole&#x2010;star, 
                       which <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> identifies as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CASSIOPEIACONSTELLATION">Cassiopeia</name>; 
                       and then he is captured by the &#x201C;grandeur and beauty&#x201D; of the &#x201C;glorious constellation&#x201D; <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, 
                       which &#x201C;he could not help observing . . . by intervals, all the evening&#x201D; as &#x201C;it seemed to pass on, in a right line drawn from east to west&#x201D;

                   <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> begins his poem with <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy</persName>&#x02BC;s admiration of the &#x201C;grandeur and beauty&#x201D; of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> rather than with the practical lesson initiated by

                        who advise first finding <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>, then tracing its pointer stars to the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#NORTHSTAR">Pole Star</name>, 
                        thereby enabling one to locate the other northern circumpolar constellations in relation to the Wain (i.e., <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name>, the Great Bear). As <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> explains, &#x201C;by remembering these stars&#x201D; 
                        that form <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>, one can &#x201C;very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><hi rend="italic">History of Sandford and Merton</hi></title></ref>, 163; see also

                       This is the practical recommendation by <persName type="fictional" corresp="#HARRYTD">Harry Sandford</persName>, the farmer&#x02BC;s boy, for how to find one&#x02BC;s way when lost on a dark night. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, in lines 7&#x2013;11, does name a cluster of circumpolar constellations, 
                       starting with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>. First, however, he predicates his sequence 
                        on beauty rather than pragmatism, by beginning the poem with &#x201C;stars&#x201D; traditionally regarded as the most beautiful&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the so&#x2010;called Morning Star and Evening Star, 
                        &#x201C;Glittering in the evening air&#x201D;, a wandering rather than a fixed star; and &#x201C;beside it&#x201D;, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion&#x02BC;s Belt</name>, 
                        &#x201C;a glorious sight for all sky loving men&#x201D;. Even for <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s drier <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName>, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> is &#x201C;by far the most beautiful of . . . all&#x201D; planets, prompting a quotation from <persName corresp="#JMILTON">Milton</persName> praising the Evening and Morning Star; 
                        and for <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Merton</persName>, &#x201C;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>, which rose every night and glittered in the south&#x201D;, entices his continuing star&#x2010;gazing, perhaps also supplying <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> with his rhapsodic modifier 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title></ref>, 2:198;

                        From this glittering horizon, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem leads the eye aloft along the ecliptic to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>, &#x201C;high / On his throne&#x201D; 
                        and thence to the circumpolar &#x201C;greater bear&#x201D; with &#x201C;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">charles&#x02BC;s wain</name>&#x201D;.</p>
                    
                   <p>Beyond initially declaring the constellations &#x201C;a glorious sight&#x201D; as opposed to a utilitarian compass, 
                       does the poem go on to form a coherent graphic translation of the sky? 
                       If, as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s belated note in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> admits, the poem&#x02BC;s sequence of constellation names are &#x201C;not next in the sky&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, 
                       if the poem does not in a systematic manner, as <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName> &#x201C;&#x2018;entreat[s]&#x2019;&#x201D;, perform the functionally pedagogical purpose 
                       of &#x201C;&#x2018;plac[ing] the marks just as I see the stars placed in the sky; and . . . writ[ing] the names for me, 
                       . . . till I was acquainted with all the stars in the heavens&#x2019;&#x201D;&#x2014;then what pattern, if any, is formed by situating the constellations &#x201C;next in this poetry&#x201D;? 
                       Does the ordering of the constellations in the poem reveal an aesthetic, if not a practical aim?</p>
                   
                   <p>While the poem&#x02BC;s repeated &#x201C;next&#x201D; seems to line up the constellation names without a plan, 
                       the sequence of naming can be interpreted as the equivalent of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>&#x02BC;s paper globe&#x2014;that is, 
                       the constellation names inscribe a formal pattern on a star map that reads as a spherical shape plotted on a flat plane. As mentioned 
                       at the start of this Discussion, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did own a celestial globe. 
                       Print sources were also available to him that contained examples of planispheres, such as <persName corresp="#AJ">Jamieson</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                       <title type="artwork" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLASPL1">&#x201C;Stereographic Projection of the Northern Celestial Hemisphere on the Plane of the Equinoctial&#x201D; 
                           (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JAMIESONCELESTIALATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Celestial Atlas</hi></title></ref>, pl. 1)</title>. 
                       <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem can be read as reversing <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>&#x02BC;s suggestion, 
                       by flattening a celestial globe or dome of the sky on paper in the manner of a &#x201C;stereographic projection&#x201D;. 
                       The eye of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s speaker inscribes a series of arcs, first by anchoring a &#x201C;glorious sight&#x201D;: &#x201C;there&#x201D; is <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> &#x201C;in the evening air&#x201D;, 
                       with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> &#x201C;beside it&#x201D;. Then, having anchored <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> on a horizontal plane, 
                       the speaker raises the eye &#x201C;high&#x201D; to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARSPLANET">Mars</name>, thus forming an arc. 
                       <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> anchors an on the horizon and inscribes a spatial arc upward in the sky. 
                       As the poem goes on to name the constellations, a spatial pattern emerges of repeated anchoring and arcing, tracing a verbal planisphere.</p>
                   
                   <p>The sequence begins with the northern circumpolar constellations (lines 7&#x2013;11), as do the printed scientific dialogues. 
                       In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sources, the dialogues typically identify only a few of these constellations&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> inside of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name>, 
                       its pointer stars leading the eye to the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#POLARIS">Pole Star</name>, which forms the tip of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name>&#x02BC;s tail. 
                       In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem, the circumpolar constellations serve repeatedly as an anchor to which the sequence returns at fairly regular intervals: 
                       <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli</name> (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart, line 13), <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name> (Little Bear, line 18), 
                       <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CEPHEUS">Cepheus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#BOOTES">Bootes</name> (line 27), <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYNX">Lynx</name> (line 30), and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAMELOPARDALIS">Cameleopardalis</name> (line 33). 
                       In between these returns to the center, the poem arcs outward by naming constellations on the periphery of the planisphere. 
                       This oscillating pattern begins by naming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name> (the Swan, line 12), which, 
                       viewed from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName>, skirts the north&#x2010;northeast horizon (i.e., at 9:00 P.M. in the evening, to adopt <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName>&#x02BC;s standard, and choosing the <date notBefore="1828-01" notAfter="1828-04">first quarter of 1828</date> for observation). 
                       From <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, the poem&#x02BC;s next&#x2010;named constellation (<name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli</name>) returns the viewer to the center, only to be directed back to the periphery with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MEDUSACONSTELLATION">Caput Medusae</name> (Medusa&#x02BC;s Head, line 14, as originally drafted and fair&#x2010;copied), 
                       which lies on the north&#x2010;northwest horizon. This time, before returning to the center, the next named constellation circles the viewer back to the northeast horizon near <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, 
                       by calling out <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus</name> (Little Horse), <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> (Goose), and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYRA">Lyra</name> (Lyre) (lines 15&#x2013;17). Then back to the center (<name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name>), only to rebound to the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name> group in the northeast by naming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULA">Vulpecula</name> (the Fox, line 19; see plates 14&#x2013;15 of <name type="toy" corresp="#URANIASMIRROR"><hi rend="italic">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</hi></name>, which picture all these constellations). 
                       The pattern is comparable to placing one&#x02BC;s thumb on the polar north of a celestial globe, or on the center&#x2010;point of a planisphere map of the northern hemisphere, 
                       and extending one&#x02BC;s fingers first toward the quadrant containing <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, and then rotating toward the quadrant containing <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PERSEUSCONSTELLATION">Perseus et Caput Medusae</name>, and then back again.</p>
                   
                   <p>Having established this sideways rotation, at line 20 the poem plunges into the southern hemisphere, casting a meridian arc from North Pole to South Pole. 
                       Thus, a circle becomes a sphere. Naming the &#x201C;blessed cross&#x201D;, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> forms a latitudinal vector that can point simultaneously north and south, 
                       since the name <hi rend="italic">cross</hi> can refer either to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, which is also known as the Northern Cross, 
                       or to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Crux</name>, the Southern Cross. To confirm the southern direction, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> next names <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</name> (Charles&#x02BC;s Oak, line 21), which is nearly adjacent to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Crux</name>. 
                       Then, sending a latitudinal line back up the sphere, the sequence passes through <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRATER">Crater</name> (the Cup, line 22)&#x2014;a 
                       southern constellation that, unlike <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Crux</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</name>, lies far enough north to be visible from <placeName corresp="#LONDON">London</placeName> on the southwest horizon. 
                       Continuing north, the poem lands on <name type="astronomical" corresp="#HERCULESCONSTELLATION">Hercules</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CERBERUSCONSTELLATION">Cerberus</name> (lines 23&#x2013;24), near the northern pole. 
                       Having inscribed this latitudinal circle, the poem returns to the longitudinal circle by again naming constellations in the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name> group&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#LACERTA">Lacerta</name> (the Lizard, line 25), 
                       and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#AQUILACONSTELLATION">Aquila</name> (the Eagle, line 26). Finally, the poem regains the northern pole by naming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CEPHEUSCONSTELLATION">Cepheus</name>, the King, and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#BOOTES">Bootes</name>, the Huntsman, (line 27), 
                       constellations that are balanced on nearly opposite sides of the pole. And then the poem loops to the South Pole again, 
                       naming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#APUS">Apus</name> (Bird of Paradise, line 28, Anglicized as the English &#x201C;Hirundo&#x201D; or Swallow, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s translation).</p>

                 and then he settles for the flattened diagram of <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TUTORJJ">Tutor</persName> 
                 (see <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-DIALOGUES">Astronomical Education: Instructional Dialogues on Astronomy</ref>&#x2014;<persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#JOYCESCIENTIFICDIALOGUES"><hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></title> and <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DAYSANDFORDANDMERTON"><hi rend="italic">The History of Sandford and Merton</hi></title>).</p>
                    
                   <p>One can test this theory by searching for a pattern in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence of constellations. 
                       At line 12, following the circumpolar constellations, the next listed constellation is <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus (the Swan)</name>. 
                       Assuming, for consistency&#x02BC;s sake, the hour of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s setting in the west in <date when="1828-04">April 1828</date>, <name type="astonomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name> would have lain on the northeast horizon, beyond <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DRACO">Draco</name>. 
                       Then the following item, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSHEART">Cor Caroli (Charles&#x02BC;s Heart)</name> would have directed the viewer back toward the center of the dome, 
                       within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CANESVENATICI">Canes Venatici (Hunting Dogs)</name>, between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMAJOR">Ursa Major</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#COMABERENICES">Coma Berenices</name>. 
                       For the next, the now obsolete constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM-HERSCHELII"><persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">Herschel</persName>&#x02BC;s Telescope</name>, one would have turned back toward the west, 
                       where it would have been rising as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> was setting, located within <name type="astronomical" corresp="#AURIGA">Auriga (the Charioteer)</name>. 
                       The next, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus (Little Horse)</name>, is found between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#PEGASUSCONSTELLATION">Pegasus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#DELPHINUS">Delphinus</name>, 
                       which would have lain back toward <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, rising on the northeast horizon as the evening advanced on April 28. The next named constellation, the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Goose (Anser)</name>, does keep within range of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#EQUULEUS">Equuleus</name>; 
                       however, to get from <name type="astronomical" corresp="ANSER">Goose</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name>&#x2014;<name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> to <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus (hare)</name>&#x2014;again sends one in the opposite direction, to the feet of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>.</p>
                   
                   <p>At this point in the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#RFT70">RF T70</title> draft, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> originally cited <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYRA">Lyra (the Lyre)</name>, which he replaced with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Lepus (Hare)</name>. 
                       Since <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LYRA">Lyra</name> is found in the same quadrant as <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CYGNUS">Cygnus</name>, by substituting <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name>, which lies at <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name>&#x02BC;s feet, 
                       <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> maintained a pattern of back&#x2010;and&#x2010;forth, west&#x2010;to&#x2010;east and back again (or counter&#x2010;clockwise circling), but in naming <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEPUS">Hare</name> he also 
                       dropped below the celestial equator to &#x201C;some of the southern&#x201D; constellations, as his title mentions. A few lines later, he will plunge into the corresponding southern constellations 
                       on the opposite side with <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CRUX">Crux (Southern Cross)</name>. It seems to break the pattern that, intervening between these southern constellations, 
                       <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> lists <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor (Lesser Bear)</name>, 
                       which contains the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#POLARIS">Pole Star</name>, but perhaps he paused midway across the sky only to rhyme <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bear</hi>. 
                       He may also have wanted <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name>. to stand as a barrier between <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ANSER">Anser</name>, &#x201C;stupid goose&#x201D;, and &#x201C;cunning fox&#x201D; (<name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula</name>), 
                       which follows <name type="astronomical" corresp="#URSAMINOR">Ursa Minor</name> in the list. Traditionally, Fox and Goose were treated as a single constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VULPECULAETANSER">Vulpecula et Anser</name>, 
                       with the Goose caught in the Fox&#x02BC;s mouth (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><persName corresp="#IRIDPATH">Ridpath</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#RIDPATHSTARTALES"><hi rend="italic">Star Tales</hi></title></ref>, 182&#x2013;83). 
                       By separating them, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> characteristically avoided violence.</p>
                   
                   <p>It seems a fool&#x02BC;s errand to look for an equivalent of <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>&#x02BC;s paper globe 
                       in what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself characterized as a poetic order&#x2014;&#x201C;constellations . . . next in this poetry . . . not next in the sky&#x201d;. 
                       Whatever poetic idea directed his eye (and intriguingly, governed his choices for revision) in moving from constellation to constellation, 
                       the most dramatic poetic evolution of the poem lay in the addition and revision of the poem&#x02BC;s conclusion in the two fair copies. 
                       For this development, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may have looked neither to a real nor a paper sky, 
                       but to a theatrical projection.</p>
                   
                   
                   <p>As <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem clicks along, however, while repeating &#x201c;next&#x201D; and &#x201c;next&#x201D; 
                       the sequence becomes erratic. As suggested by the poem&#x02BC;s title, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to have extended belatedly in order to account for &#x201C;some of the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">zodiac</name> and some of the southern&#x201D; constellations 
                       that had found their way into the poem along with the survey of the visible &#x201C;northern&#x201D; sky (see <ref type="intenal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>), the sequence reveals a logic at best only intermittently 
                       (see <ref type="internal" target="#REAL-LIFE">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201D; as a Record of Actual Astronomical Observations</ref>). Aware of the systematic procedure advised by his books&#x02BC; astronomy lessons, he added the caveat, 
                       &#x201C;These constellations though they are next in this poetry are not next in the sky&#x201d;, 
                       to the second and final fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>). Whatever led his fancy, the poem is livelier 
                       than <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName>&#x02BC;s bare and wooden lists set up alongside Bible verses for rote memorization.</p>-->

                            including <name type="astronomical" corresp="#TELESCOPIUM-HERSCHELII">Telescopium Herschelii (<persName corresp="#WHERSCHEL">Herschel</persName>&#x02BC;s Telescope)</name>

                            requiring a plunge into southern constellations invisible to British viewers. 
                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> also lends an English inflection to constellation names where possible: for example, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#APUS">Apus</name> is not the tropical Bird of Paradise 
                            but the northern Swallow; <name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEO">Leo</name> is not the fierce <name type="animal" corresp="#NEMEANLION">Nemean Lion</name> but the &#x201C;generous&#x201D; and therefore, one supposes, British kingly beast

                        of dividing the lists of constellation names between ancient and modern constellations&#x2014;those with British associations being numbered only among the modern.

                        and her design may have been equally animated by a wariness of pre&#x2010;Christian star legends.</p>-->
                    
                    <p>British pride in the nation&#x02BC;s standing in astronomy was aroused by competition with the French. 
                        The French astronomer, <persName corresp="#NLL">Nicolas&#x2010;Louis de Lacaille</persName> (<date notBefore="1713" notAfter="1762">1713&#x2013;62</date>), who mapped the stars in the southern hemisphere 
                        from the vantage of the <placeName corresp="#CAPEOFGOODHOPE">Cape of Good Hope</placeName> in <placeName corresp="#SAFRICA">south Africa</placeName>, took aim at <placeName corresp="#ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur Carolinum</placeName>, which honored <persName corresp="#KC2">Charles II</persName> of <placeName corresp="#ENGLAND">England</placeName>. 
                        As <persName corresp="#NLL">Lacaille</persName> created numerous new constellations of his own in the southern hemisphere, he eliminated the British honorific constellation, 
                        criticizing its inventor, the English astronomer <persName corresp="#EHALLEY">Edmond Halley</persName> (<date notBefore="1656" notAfter="1742">1656&#x2013;1742</date>), for an illogical redistribution of stars originally 
                        belonging to the ancient southern constellation, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ARGONAVIS">Argo Navis</name> (the Ship of the <orgName type="fictional" corresp="#ARGONAUTS">Argonauts</orgName>). 
                        Restoring <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur</name>&#x02BC;s stars to the ship&#x02BC;s prow, <persName corresp="#NLL">Lacaille</persName> justified uprooting <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ROBURCAROLINUM">Robur</name> on ostensibly scientific grounds, 
                        given that new constellations typically were formed from &#x201C;unformed&#x201D; stars&#x2014;that is, stars ignored by <persName corresp="#PTOLEMY">Ptolemy</persName> in plotting the ancient constellations&#x2014;rather 
                        than by robbing old constellations of their stars for new configurations. In designing his own new constellations, 
                        <persName corresp="#NLL">Lacaille</persName> was inspired by an Enlightenment principle of honoring the modern arts and sciences rather than paying tribute to individual monarchs. 
                        Historians suspect <persName corresp="#LACAILLE">Lacaille</persName>, however, of a prejudicial view when targeting specifically a British honorific constellation, 
                        while inconsistently retaining constellations that paid tribute to other nations&#x02BC; rulers 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><persName corresp="#JCBARENTINE">Barentine</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#BARENTINELOSTCONSTELLATIONS"><hi rend="italic">Lost Constellations</hi></title></ref>, 352&#x2013;54). 
                        The rivalry persisted in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s time, when an <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date> British astronomy manual bitterly mocked an attempt

                        was in the news when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was composing <title type="poem" corresp="#JRTHECONSTELLATIONS">&#x201C;The Constellations&#x201C;</title> 
                        and may have animated his choice to name the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CAMELOPARDALIS">Camelopardalis (the Giraffe)</name>, 
                        although he assigns it no contextualizing epithet. In <date notBefore="1827" notAfter="1828">1827&#x2013;28</date>, the first living specimen of a giraffe 
                        was imported to <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">Britain</placeName>, an event that spurred competition with <placeName corresp="#FRANCE">France</placeName>, which also received a specimen

                    <p>As shown by the revision of the fair copy in RF T70, even this caveat did not suffice. In this peroration, 
                        Ruskin struck out "history" and substituted "knowledge", thus extending the sway of "virtue" over a potentially broader scope of ways of knowing. 
                        Objectionable knowledge in this poem took two forms, as suggested by the lines that his mother flagged for revision and Ruskin's consequent revisions: 
                        evocations of horror or violence, and examples of paganism that approached blasphemy from a Christian perspective 
                        (see <ref type="internal" target="COMPPUB-FIRST-FAIR-COPY-MR">Margaret Ruskin&#x02BC;s Role in the Fair&#x2010;Copying Process</ref>).</p>
                    
                    <p>In the print sources on astronomy available to Ruskin in the 1820s, the problem of reconciling astronomical knowledge--scientific or "historical" (i.e., mytholological and pre-Christian)--adopted a range 
                        of approaches. In <title type="book" corresp="#SHERWOODASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">Introduction to Astronomy Intended for Little Children</hi></title>, 
                        <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> cannot avoid the pagan, mythical names of the constellations, but she avoids alluding to the myths themselves, 
                        defining the constellations neutrally as &#x201C;remarkable groups or clusters of stars, to which names of various figures have been given&#x201D;. 
                        She does not pursue the identity of the figures or their stories, presumably fearing that a fascination with the myths approaches idolatry, 
                        as suggested by a quotation she delivers from <title type="scripture" corresp="#CHRONICLES">Chronicles</title>: 
                        &#x201C;For great is the <persName type="scriptural" corresp="#CREATOR">Lord</persName>, and greatly to be praised:

                        (<title type="scripture" corresp="#1CHRONICLES">1 Chron 16</title>: 25&#x2013;26). Instead, <persName corresp="#MMS">Mrs. Sherwood</persName> 
                        directs admiration of the stars toward Christian praise: &#x201C;We find in Scripture the glory of the righteous in the resurrection compared to that of the stars; 
                        by which comparison we find, that their splendour will partake of that of the Son of God himself&#x201;

                    <p>In between these extremes, in <title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</hi></title>, <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Jehoshaphat Aspin</persName> takes a moderate path, 
                        treating the mythic origins of the constellations as useful knowledge: &#x201C;The names and figures are of very ancient date, 
                        and are still retained for the sake of distinction, as well as to avoid confusion in comparing ancient with modern observations&#x201D; 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ASPINASTRONOMY"><title type="book" corresp="#ASPINASTRONOMY"><hi rend="italic">A Familiar Treatise on Astronomy</hi></title></ref>, 102). 
                        This functional justification does not prevent <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName> from summarizing the &#x201C;fables&#x201D; associated with each of the constellations&#x2014;summaries keyed to the cards depicting the mythical figures, 
                        which are collected in <name type="toy" corresp="#URANIASMIRROR"><hi rend="italic">Urania&#x02BC;s Mirror</hi></name>. 
                        <persName corresp="#JASPIN">Aspin</persName> reconciles the pagan tales with Christian revelaton by occasionally interpreting 
                        the mythical figures as biblical types (in the contextual glosses on the poem, see Aspin's commentary, e.g., on 
                        <ref type="glosses" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#ORIONGLOSS"><name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name></ref>,

                    <p>Jacob Green, Aspin's American competitor for the market in illustrated guides to the mythology of the constellations, 
                        and Alexander Jamieson, whose illustrations in the Celestial Atlas were plagiarized by the artists for both Green's Astronomical Recreations and 
                        for Urania's Mirror, were given to jousting with more specific theological controversies surrounding astronomical lore. 
                        Green fumed, for example, over the controversy surrounding the Zodiac of Dendera--an Egyptian stone antiquity representating the zodiac, 
                        which was purloined by French agents during the Napoleonic era and believed by some savants to predate the generations of Noah by thousands of years. 
                        Contradicting the biblical narrative, the Zodiac of Dendera appeared to present an alignment of equinoxes with constellations that the artifact's creators 
                        could have witnessed only in an ancient sky from long before the Flood, as proven by calculations based on the precession of the earth's poles. 
                        This controversy, which provoked a surprising investment of scientific, philologial, theological, and political attention 
                        (see Buchwald and Josefowicz, The Zodiac of Paris), 
                        was countered dismissively by Green with an appeal to the popular theological lectures of Thomas Chalmers 
                        (see the contextual gloss on <ref type="glosses" target="constellations_glosses_contextual.php#LEOGLOSS"><name type="astronomical" corresp="#LEO">Leo (the Lion)</name></ref>). 
                        While Green's appeal is complacent and reactionary, Chalmers's blending of natural theology and Scottish evangelicalism 
                        probably reflected the standing of Ruskin's parents on questions of conflict between science and biblical authority. 
                        The family library included a copy of <persName corresp="#TCHALMERS">Chalmers</persName>'s <title type="book" corresp="#CHALMERSASTRONOMICAL"><hi rend="italic">Discourses on the Christian Revelation Viewed in Connection with the Modern Astronomy</hi></title> (<date when="1817">1817</date>), 
                        which sought to refute skeptical arguments that the evidence of astronomy undermines the truth of Christian revelation 
                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><persName corresp="#JSD">Dearden</persName>, <title type="book" corresp="#DEARDENRUSKINLIBRARY"><hi rend="italic">Library of John Ruskin</hi></title></ref>, 67 [no. 473];

                    <p>Within this range of solutions to reconciling secular astronomical learning with the sacred, Ruskin is unequal to the third approach--an engagement 
                        with the varieties of natural theology, which attempt a dialogue between science and faith--but he combines the other two approaches in the conclusion 
                        to "The Constellations". First, in his declaration that "history" or "knowledge" is less "bright" than "virtue", he effectively adopts Mrs. Sherwood's strategy 
                        of bluntly subordinating astronomical facts to Bible quotations. Comparing their treatments of the planet Mercury, 
                        which Ruskin likens to virtue, one finds Mrs. Sherwood's information about that planet dominated by a quotation from Acts. 
                        Paul and Barnabas, while preaching in the Roman colony of Lycaonia, are horrified to be confused by their audience with pagan gods, Mercury (Hermes) and Jupiter (Zeus). 
                        Amazed that Paul successfully commanded a cripple to walk, the Lycaonians "lifted up their voices, saying . . . 
                        'The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!'". The point of the episode is to condemn as idolatrous 
                        any knowledge other than the apostles' witness. In Mrs. Sherwood's transcription:</p>

                                <p>And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker. 
                                    Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, 
                                    and would have done sacrifice with the people. Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, 
                                    heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? 
                                    We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, 
                                    which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein.</p>

                    <p>In the exercise that Mrs. Sherwood recommends for the use of her book, the child reader is expected to memorize and recite 
                        this passage of scripture along with a few facts about the planet (see 
                        <ref type="note" subtype="contextual" target="astronomy_note.php#PRINTSOURCES-PRIMERS">Astronomical Education: Astronomical Primers for Children</ref>). 
                        No application of the scripture is invited or necessary, since the message is flattened to the solitary implication that any learning is idolatrous that fails to lead to praise of the Creator.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ruskin's comparison of "beauteous" Mercury with virtue entails an additional level of interpretation, however, 
                        since his choice of Mercury implies a typological reading based on knowledge that Mrs. Sherwood prohibits--the 
                        myths of Hermes. Even the story from Acts requires such knowledge to explain why the Lycaonians believed Paul to be Hermes, given that 
                        "he was the chief speaker". Ruskin may have found an explanation in a reference work on Greek and Roman mythology known to have existed in the family library, 
                        and probably acquired in the 1820s when he composed "The Constellations":

                                    an ingenious writer of the present age (John Horne Tooke, in his Diversions of Purley) 
                                    has considered the wings which this God annexes to his feet, as emblematical of the wings 
                                    which language gives to the thoughts of men.</p>
                                
                                <p>(Baldwin [pseud. Godwin], The Pantheon, 58)</p>

                    <p>While this extended gloss identifies Mercury with oratory, Ruskin's more surprising association of the deity with virtue 
                        requires examining the effects of eloquence. To make this case, The Pantheon is a compelling source, 
                        since Godwin disassociates Mercury from the evil uses of rhetoric, just as he exonerates the god from dishonest uses of buying and selling, 
                        in his role as "inventor of traffic, . . . said to have introduced the use of weights, measures, and contracts". 
                        In an exception that John James Ruskin would perhaps have appreciated, Godwin argues that "licentiousness" in 
                        the "Greek imagination" led them to have "indecorously represented Mercury as the God of thieves", 
                        since a failing lies in human nature and in the system of traffic itself, which is "too apt to degenerate into a system of fraud": 
                        "[W]hen men engage in buying and selling and barter as a profession, the more keen and grasping among them will endeavour to buy cheap and sell dear, 
                        and cozen and overreach those with whom they have any dealings" 
                        (Baldwin [pseud. Godwin], The Pantheon, 58).</p>
                    
                    <p>Thus, whereas Mrs. Sherwood's exercise sets up a hierarchy of whole categories of knowledge, Godwin's approach undertakes to educate 
                        the child reader's own imagination, which he engages by humanizing the sacred: 
                        "There are many things related of this God, which forcibly suggest to us the idea of a man, 
                        who for his great and essential services to his fellow-beings, was worshipped as a divinity after his death". 
                        Mercury wields magical powers by virtue of his <hi rend="italic">caduceus</hi>--the winged wand coiled by two serpents, which he carries--but 
                        the magic resides less in this instrument itself than in its uses, its "sovereign power in appeasing quarrels and controversies":</p>

                                <p>if the God touched with . . . [the caduceus] two mortal enemies, they instantly began to regard each other with eyes of affection: 
                                    one of the earliest experiments that was made of it in this respect, happened thus: two serpents were fighting with terrible fierceness; 
                                    their eyes flashed fire, their hissings were infernal, it seemed as if the combat could end in nothing less than the destruction of both: 
                                    Mercury, happening to come by, touched them with his wand; they were immediately at peace; 
                                    they embraced each other; they wreathed themselves round the instrument of their reconciliation, 
                                    and remained ever after the ornament of the caduceus of the God.</p>

                    <p>This direction of the imagination toward fellow-feeling characterizes Margaret Ruskin's uses of Godwin's texts. 
                        In place of the lines of "The Constellations" that she marked for revision, Ruskin substituted epithets, 
                        which reference stories of mutual help and generosity taken from Godwin's Aesopian collection,

                                in the tactic of starting from a prominent point of reference in the sky, although not, in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, with a constellation, but with a planet, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name>, the so&#x2010;called Morning Star and Evening Star, 
                                which is a wandering rather than a fixed star. &#x201C;Dost thou see&#x201D;, the poem asks, how <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> is associated with the constellation <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion</name> 
                                as these bodies fall below the horizon in the west? From there, the poem turns to the next planet on the ecliptic, <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>, 
                                and then re&#x2010;orients to the circumpolar constellations overhead. The method does not adopt <persName type="fictional" corresp="#TOMMYTD">Tommy Sandford</persName>&#x02BC;s more practical and reliable recommendation of first finding <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name> and then tracing its pointer stars to the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#NORTHSTAR">Pole Star</name>; 
                                instead, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s sequence starts from &#x201C;stars&#x201D; traditionally regarded as the most beautiful&#x2014;the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUS">Evening Star</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ORION">Orion&#x02BC;s Belt</name>, 
                                &#x201C;a glorious sight for all sky loving men&#x201D;&#x2014;and thence carries on to the circumpolar formations. From this more sublimely oriented beginning, the poem does proceed to follow <persName type="fictional" corresp="#BARLOWTD">Mr. Barlow</persName>&#x02BC;s advice, 
                                that &#x201C;by remembering these stars [of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#CHARLESSWAIN">Charles&#x02BC;s Wain</name>], you may very easily observe those which are next to them, and learn their names too, till you are acquainted with the whole face of the heavens&#x201D;

                                <p>As <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem clicks along, however, while repeating &#x201c;next&#x201D; and &#x201c;next&#x201D; 
                                the sequence becomes erratic.

                                that had found their way into the poem along with the survey of the visible &#x201C;northern&#x201D; sky (see <ref type="intenal" target="#TITLE">Title</ref>), the sequence reveals a logic at best only intermittently

                                to the second and final fair copy (<title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>). Whatever led his fancy, the poem is livelier

                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem leaves one guessing even about his knowledge of mythology, however, 
                                since he invests each constellation with an epithet that lends a poetic coloring without necessarily alluding to its mythological associations (and sometimes contradicting or deflecting from the commonly associated stories).

                            &#x201C;particularly interesting to <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>&#x201D; thanks only to &#x201C;the pains he had taken, and the various attempts he had made, 
                            to understand and to represent&#x201D; the revolving bodies. The other &#x201C;little children&#x201D; in the audience went &#x201C;dead asleep&#x201D; 
                            and &#x201C;even he&#x201D;, <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName>, &#x201C;after all his reading in [<persName corresp="#JJ">Jeremiah Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s]

                            <persName corresp="#ME">Edgeworth</persName>&#x02BC;s most severe criticism is aimed at the failure to scale knowledge to the age&#x2014;appropriate accessibility of young listeners. 
                            The lecturer overwhelms the audience &#x201C;with a vast number of words, which&#x201D; <persName type="fictional" corresp="#FRANKME">Frank</persName> &#x201C;strained his attention&#x201D; to understand,

                            It is the sight of the real moon on the ride home that prompts a spontaneous appreciation of sublimity from <persName type="fictional" corresp="#MARYME">Mary</persName>:

                                    The stars, disposed in constellations, and surrounded by concentric circles, may perhaps assist the imagination a little:

                                    perhaps we should find ourselves on the confines of creation, and see as many stars before us as we left behind! 
                                    For space has neither top nor bottom in it; it is a circle whose centre is every where, but whose circumference is no where!&#x201D; (pp. 36&#x2013;37).</item>

                            the most comprehensive view of the constellations was presented as the finale. Could <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> have conceived of his poem 
                            as an ekphrastic version of this final, totalizing scene? Apparently, in this show, a transparency 
                            exhibited a circle of the starry night, surrounded by concentric rings to suggest infinitude. 
                            In an engraving by <persName corresp="#ISTOW">I. Stow</persName> (ca. <date notBefore="1770" notAfter="1823">1770&#x2013;1823</date>), after <persName corresp="#EBURNEY">E. F. Burney</persName> (<date notBefore="1760" notAfter="1848">1760&#x2013;1848</date>),

                            published by <persName corresp="#RW">Robert Wilkinson</persName>, Scene 1 represented the earth and sun by turning the orbit vertically to the audience, 
                            enclosing this revolution of the Eidouranion within a projection of an outer ring, which showed the <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">Zodiac</name> constellations. 
                            The <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">Zodiac</name> constellations were represented by their respective mythological figures. 
                            Perhaps the transparency for the Last Scene exhibited a similar ring of constellations in their mythological guise, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> in his way has reproduced.</p>
                        
                        <p>The beginning of the poem, however, starts with a version of Scene 1 in the Walkers&#x02BC; exhibition&#x2014;or more precisely, a portion of their Scene 4&#x2014;with 
                            the rising and setting of <name type="astronomical" corresp="#VENUSPLANET">Venus</name> and <name type="astronomical" corresp="#MARS">Mars</name>. 
                            As noted earlier, the poem is atypical of <persName corresp="#TD">Day</persName>&#x02BC;s and <persName corresp="#JJ">Joyce</persName>&#x02BC;s 
                            introductions to the constellations, which begin with finding the circumpolar constellations in the sky. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> 
                            incorporates that observation as the second stage of his poem. The <name type="astronomical" corresp="#ZODIAC">Zodiac</name> constellations form a distinct piece within the poem. 
                            The most significant point to draw from the context of the Lenten astronomy lectures is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s catalogue 
                            may have attempted a sublime totality, an expression of religious awe.</p>
